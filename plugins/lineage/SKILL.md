# Lineage & Impact Analysis

## When to Use/Load

Activate this skill for **any** of:

- **Impact analysis (downstream)**: "what depends on X", "what will break if I change X", "blast radius", "who uses X", "downstream of X", "cascade", "deprecate X", "before I modify X", "affected users".
- **Root cause (upstream)**: "root cause", "trace upstream from X", "where does X come from", "where do the numbers in X come from", "feeds X", "sources of X", "follow the data back".
- **Column-level lineage**: "what uses column Y", "where does column Y come from", "trace column Y", "column impact", "column source". (Note: "has column X changed recently?" is a **metadata** question — use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS` and `ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` directly; it does not require `GET_LINEAGE`.)
- **Data discovery / trust / provenance**: "is X trustworthy", "is X the right table", "which table should I use for Z", "recommend a dataset for Z", "verify source", "provenance", "certify X".

> **External lineage (Horizon + Select Star Private Preview).** On accounts with the Preview enabled, the same `GET_LINEAGE` queries return additional rows representing external entities (Power BI dashboards, Tableau workbooks, dbt models in external warehouses, etc.) that connect to the Snowflake-side anchor. The skill detects these rows in output and presents them — see `reference/external-row-output.md`. **Direct anchoring on an external entity** (e.g. *"what feeds this Power BI dashboard?"* as a cold question) is not a supported customer path today: there's no SQL to enumerate external entities by name without a Snowflake-side anchor first. When asked, tell the customer to anchor on a Snowflake table or view they know is connected; the external entity will surface in the result.

**Trigger indicators:** Any question about dependencies between Snowflake objects, where data comes from or flows to, or whether an object is the right one to use.

### CLI shortcut: `cortex lineage`

Cortex Code also exposes a one-shot CLI form that calls the same `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE` under the hood as this skill's templates:

```bash
cortex lineage "<DB>.<SCHEMA>.<OBJECT>" --direction downstream --distance 5 --tree
```

When to prefer the CLI vs. the SQL templates in this skill:

| Use the CLI (`cortex lineage`) | Use the SQL templates here |
|---|---|
| One-shot tree view of upstream or downstream of a single object | Need **risk tiers**, **affected users**, **usage stats**, **trust scoring** |
| Simple "what depends on X" or "where does X come from" | Need **multi-source joins** (lineage + ACCESS_HISTORY + tags + contacts) |
| Quick interactive exploration | Reproducible analytics that need to be filtered, persisted, or reported |

The CLI does not currently expose a column-level mode — for column lineage use this skill's `column-lineage-get-lineage.sql` template.

**Cross-skill:** If the user reports **value-level data quality issues** (e.g. "weird data", "missing emails", "wrong numbers", "failing DMFs"), load and run the **data-quality** skill first; then use **this** skill to trace upstream to the root cause. Do not invoke `data-quality` for "which table should I use" or "where do the numbers come from" — those are **lineage** questions.

**Before writing GET_LINEAGE SQL:** Read [`reference/snowflake-apis.md`](reference/snowflake-apis.md) — it has the canonical namespace, argument order, output column names, and the `LATERAL FLATTEN` pattern for `ACCESS_HISTORY`.

## Core principles

- **ALWAYS use `GET_LINEAGE` first** for any object dependency question — downstream or upstream. Do NOT start with `ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES`, `ACCESS_HISTORY`, `GRANTS_TO_ROLES`, or `SHOW GRANTS`. Those are auxiliary signals (usage / privileges), not lineage sources.
- **`ACCESS_HISTORY` is for usage/user attribution only**, and only **after** `GET_LINEAGE` has already returned the objects in scope.
- **Early-stop on empty `ACCESS_HISTORY`**: if `ACCESS_HISTORY` returns 0 rows for the lineage targets within the lookback window, conclude **"no user/usage data available"** and stop. Do NOT cascade through `OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES`, `GRANTS_TO_ROLES`, `GRANTS_TO_USERS`, `SHOW GRANTS` looking for a user list — those views do not capture "who would be affected" the way `ACCESS_HISTORY` does.
- **Use `OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` only as a fallback** when `GET_LINEAGE` errors out (privilege) or returns 0 rows for an object that should clearly have lineage (e.g. a view that references other tables). Zero rows from `GET_LINEAGE` on a leaf object is a valid answer; do not chase it.

## Purpose
Navigate the web of data dependencies to ensure reliability, transparency, and rapid recovery across the data ecosystem.

## How It Works

1. **User provides DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE** (e.g., "ANALYTICS_DB.REPORTING.REVENUE_SUMMARY")
2. **Agent identifies workflow** based on trigger phrases and other context
3. **Agent reads workflow file** from `workflows/` directory
4. **Agent executes template** with placeholders replaced
5. **Agent presents clean results** formatted per workflow guidelines

**Execution Approach:** Lineage queries are read-only analysis operations. Execute immediately without confirmation since they don't modify data or objects. If executing a recursive SQL query, notify the user that the analysis may take a while due to the complexity of the query.

## The 4 Workflows

> **External lineage note.** On accounts with **Horizon + Select Star Private Preview** enabled, lineage results from any of the four workflows below may include external entities (Power BI dashboards, Tableau workbooks, dbt models, etc.) as additional rows. The skill is aware of these — present them under a separate "External" header per `reference/external-row-output.md`. There is no separate "external-anchor" workflow today; direct anchoring on external entities is not a supported customer path.

### 1. Impact Analysis (Downstream)
**File:** `workflows/impact-analysis.md`
**Question:** *"If I change this, what breaks?"*
**Triggers:** "impact analysis", "what depends on this", "what will break", "downstream", "who uses this"
**Templates:** `impact-analysis.sql`, `impact-analysis-multi-level.sql`
**Output:** Downstream objects with risk tiers, usage frequency, affected users

**Snowflake APIs Used:**
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE()` - **Primary:** Object and data-movement lineage (VIEW LINEAGE, no account admin)
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` - **Fallback:** Object dependency graph only (account admin)
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` - Actual usage patterns
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` - User attribution

### 2. Root Cause Analysis (Upstream)
**File:** `workflows/root-cause-analysis.md`
**Question:** *"Why is this number wrong?"* / *"Where does this data come from?"*
**Triggers:** "root cause", "why is this wrong", "trace upstream", "where does this come from", "debug"
**Templates:** `root-cause-analysis.sql`, `change-detection.sql`
**Output:** Upstream lineage, recent changes, divergence points

**Note:** When the user reports **data quality issues** (wrong values, missing emails, failing DMFs), use the **data_quality** skill first to identify what is wrong; then use this workflow to trace upstream to find where the bad data originated.

**Snowflake APIs Used:**
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE()` - **Primary:** Upstream lineage (object + data movement)
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` - **Fallback:** Upstream object dependencies
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` - Data flow patterns
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES` / `COLUMNS` - Schema change detection
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` - Recent modifications

### 3. Data Discovery & Trust (Provenance)
**File:** `workflows/data-discovery.md`
**Question:** *"Where did this come from and is it the right tool for the job?"*
**Triggers:** "is this trustworthy", "provenance", "recommend dataset", "which table should I use", "verify source"
**Templates:** `data-discovery.sql`, `provenance-verification.sql`
**Output:** Full lineage path, usage statistics, trust indicators

**Snowflake APIs Used:**
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE()` - **Primary:** Full lineage path (object + data movement)
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` - **Fallback:** Full dependency chain
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` - Usage patterns
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLES` - Object metadata
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TABLE_STORAGE_METRICS` - Data freshness

### 4. Column-Level Lineage
**File:** `workflows/column-lineage.md`
**Question:** *"What uses this column?" / "Where does this column come from?"*
**Triggers:** "column lineage", "what uses [column]", "where does [column] come from", "trace column", "column impact", "column source"
**Templates:** `column-lineage-get-lineage.sql` (**primary**), `column-lineage-downstream.sql`, `column-lineage-upstream.sql`, `column-lineage-full.sql`
**Output:** Column-level dependencies, source columns, transformation paths

**Snowflake APIs Used:**
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE(..., 'COLUMN', ...)` - **Primary:** column lineage with no latency, no account admin (VIEW LINEAGE on PUBLIC)
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.ACCESS_HISTORY` - **Fallback:** column-level access patterns when GET_LINEAGE is empty
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.COLUMNS` - Column metadata and definitions
- `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY` - DDL changes affecting columns

---

## Execution Rules

### Step 0: Verify Session Context (once per session)

Run this **once at the start of the first query**. If you have already confirmed warehouse, database, and schema are set earlier in this conversation, skip this step.

Check the current session context:

```sql
SELECT
    CURRENT_USER()      AS current_user,
    CURRENT_ROLE()      AS current_role,
    CURRENT_DATABASE()  AS current_database,
    CURRENT_SCHEMA()    AS current_schema,
    CURRENT_WAREHOUSE() AS current_warehouse;
```

Fix any NULL or mismatched values before continuing:

| Field | Fix if NULL / wrong |
|-------|---------------------|
| `current_warehouse` | `USE WAREHOUSE <name>;` |
| `current_database`  | `USE DATABASE <database>;` |
| `current_schema`    | `USE SCHEMA <database>.<schema>;` |

**⚠️ STOP if warehouse is NULL** — `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` queries require an active warehouse.

### Core Execution Flow:
1. **Extract object identifiers** from user message:
   - Table workflows: `DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE`
   - Column workflows: `DATABASE.SCHEMA.TABLE.COLUMN`
2. **Identify workflow** from trigger phrases and the object identifier → read workflow file from `workflows/`
3. **Read SQL template** specified in workflow file
4. **Build dynamic scoring** from `config/schema-patterns.yaml` (for trust/risk placeholders)
5. **Replace placeholders** with actual values
6. **Execute and format** results per workflow guidelines

### Placeholder Replacements:
- `<database>`, `<schema>`, `<table>`, `<column>` → actual object names
- `/* SCHEMA_TRUST_SCORING:column */` → dynamic CASE statement from config
- `/* SCHEMA_TRUST_TIER:column */` → dynamic tier name CASE statement  
- `/* SCHEMA_RISK_SCORING:column */` → dynamic risk CASE statement

**Identifier validation:** Each name part must match `^[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_$]*$`. Reject any value containing quotes (`"`, `'`, `` ` ``), semicolons, spaces, or other SQL metacharacters — do not substitute it into SQL. Ask the user to confirm the correct object name instead.

### Key Principles:
- **Use templates exactly as written** - only replace placeholders
- **No confirmation prompts** for read-only lineage queries
- **Handle errors gracefully** - use fallback templates, provide clear messages
- **One workflow per request** - don't chain multiple analyses automatically

---

## Template Structure

All templates in `templates/` directory use these placeholders:
- `<database>` → Replace with actual database name
- `<schema>` → Replace with actual schema name
- `<table>` → Replace with actual table name
- `<column>` → Replace with actual column name (for column-level lineage)
- `/* SCHEMA_TRUST_SCORING:column_name */` → Dynamic CASE statement returning score (integer)
- `/* SCHEMA_TRUST_TIER:column_name */` → Dynamic CASE statement returning tier name (string)
- `/* SCHEMA_RISK_SCORING:column_name */` → Dynamic CASE statement returning 'CRITICAL' or NULL

**Example:**
```sql
-- Template:
WHERE REFERENCED_DATABASE = '<database>' 
  AND REFERENCED_SCHEMA = '<schema>' 
  AND REFERENCED_OBJECT_NAME = '<table>'

-- After replacement:
WHERE REFERENCED_DATABASE = 'ANALYTICS_DB' 
  AND REFERENCED_SCHEMA = 'REPORTING' 
  AND REFERENCED_OBJECT_NAME = 'SALES_SUMMARY'
```

---

## Dynamic Trust Scoring

Templates use dynamic placeholders for trust/risk scoring. See `reference/dynamic-trust-scoring.md` for complete documentation on:
- Placeholder syntax (`/* PLACEHOLDER_TYPE:column_name */`)
- Building CASE statements from `config/schema-patterns.yaml`
- Why dynamic scoring enables customer customization

---

## Error Handling & Fallback Strategy

**Lineage source order (static dependencies):**

1. **Primary:** `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE()` — object and data-movement lineage; requires only object-resolve + VIEW LINEAGE (granted to public). Prefer for all table/column lineage.
2. **Fallback 1:** `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` — object dependency only; requires account admin. Use **only** when the primary query **fails** (e.g. privilege error) or when you have strong reason to expect lineage but GET_LINEAGE returned empty (e.g. object is known to have dependents).
3. **Fallback 2:** `GET_DDL()` to parse view definitions for references
4. **Fallback 3:** `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` (current DB only)

**Minimize steps:** Run the primary template once. If it **succeeds** (with or without rows), present the result and **stop**—do not run the fallback. Use fallback only when the primary **errors** or when the object clearly should have lineage (e.g. a view that references other tables) but GET_LINEAGE returned 0 rows. Zero rows from GET_LINEAGE is often a valid answer (e.g. table has no downstream).

**Why GET_LINEAGE first:** OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES captures only *object dependency* (target data depends on source). GET_LINEAGE also captures *data movement* (e.g. COPY INTO, CTAS) and avoids account admin (VIEW LINEAGE is granted to public).

**Fallback templates (use only when primary fails or expected lineage is missing):**
- `impact-analysis-object-deps-fallback.sql`, `impact-analysis-multi-level-object-deps-fallback.sql`, `impact-analysis-users-object-deps-fallback.sql`
- `root-cause-analysis-object-deps-fallback.sql`, `change-detection-object-deps-fallback.sql`
- `provenance-verification-object-deps-fallback.sql`

**Further fallbacks (DDL / INFORMATION_SCHEMA):**
- `impact-analysis-fallback.sql` — DDL/INFORMATION_SCHEMA for downstream deps
- `root-cause-ddl-fallback.sql` — DDL parsing for upstream lineage

**If template fails:**
1. Run primary (GET_LINEAGE) once. On **success** (any row count), present results and stop. On **failure** (error) or **empty when lineage is expected**, try OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES fallback, then GET_DDL/INFORMATION_SCHEMA if needed.
2. Check ACCESS_HISTORY availability: `check-access-history.sql`
3. Check object existence: `check-object-exists.sql`
4. If object doesn't exist: "Object not found. Check the name and try again."
5. If no lineage data: "No lineage data available. Object may be new or unused."

**Common Issues:**
- "No ACCESS_HISTORY data" → Data is older than 365 days or not accessed
- "GET_LINEAGE returns empty" → Use fallback only if the object should have lineage (e.g. view with references); otherwise report "No lineage found."
- "Insufficient privileges" → GET_LINEAGE needs VIEW LINEAGE (public); OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES needs account admin

---

## Output Format Rules

**Always state the depth used and offer to go deeper.** At the end of every lineage result, include a line in this form:

```
Showing X level(s) of lineage. Want me to dig deeper? (max 5)
```

Where X is the distance/level count actually used. If the user already specified the maximum (5), omit the offer.

## Snowflake APIs Reference

See `reference/snowflake-apis.md` for complete documentation on:
- `SNOWFLAKE.CORE.GET_LINEAGE()` (primary) vs `ACCOUNT_USAGE.OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES` (fallback)
- Object dependency vs data-movement lineage and privilege requirements
- ACCOUNT_USAGE views and their latencies
- Performance optimization tips

For external rows that surface in results on Horizon + Select Star Private Preview accounts, see also:
- `reference/external-row-output.md` — how to recognize and present external entities (Power BI dashboards, Tableau workbooks, dbt models, etc.) in `GET_LINEAGE` output

---

## Success Criteria

- User gets answer in **one response**
- Risk tiers clearly communicated (Impact Analysis)
- Recent changes highlighted (Root Cause)
- Trust indicators provided (Discovery)
- No SQL errors shown
- No unnecessary questions
- Clean, actionable results

---

## Stopping Points

Lineage queries are **read-only operations** that don't modify data or schema. Execute immediately without waiting for confirmation.

### ⚠️ MANDATORY STOPPING POINTS

**STOP and ask user if:**
1. **Ambiguous object reference** - Missing or unclear database/schema/table/column name
   - Example: User says "check lineage" without specifying which table
   - Action: Ask "Which table would you like to analyze?"

2. **User explicitly requests review** - "Show me the query first" or "Let me review before running"
   - Action: Present the query and wait for confirmation

3. **Query returns no results** - No lineage data found
   - Action: Explain possible reasons (new object, no access, insufficient privileges) and ask if they want to try a different approach

4. **User asks to anchor lineage on an external entity** (e.g. "what feeds this Power BI dashboard?")
   - Action: Tell the user that direct anchoring on external entities is not yet supported through `GET_LINEAGE`. Ask them to anchor on a Snowflake table or view they know is connected to the external entity. The external entity will surface in the lineage result if connected. (See `reference/external-row-output.md`.)

### ✅ NO STOPPING REQUIRED

**Execute immediately without confirmation:**
- Any SELECT query on `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE` views
- Any SELECT query on `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` views
- Parsing DDL with `GET_DDL()` function
- Reading configuration files from `config/`

**Rationale:** These are read-only operations that don't modify data, schema, or access controls.

---

## Production Configuration

**Schema Pattern Configuration (Extensible):**

Trust and risk scoring patterns are defined in `config/schema-patterns.yaml`. This file is read dynamically at runtime, allowing easy customization without modifying SQL templates.

**File:** `config/schema-patterns.yaml`

```yaml
trust_tiers:
  PRODUCTION:
    score: 100
    patterns:
      - "%ANALYTICS%"
      - "%CURATED%"
      # Add your production schema patterns here
      
  STAGING:
    score: 60
    patterns:
      - "%STAG%"
      # Add your staging schema patterns here
      
  RAW:
    score: 40
    patterns:
      - "%RAW%"
      # Add your raw data schema patterns here
      
  UNTRUSTED:
    score: 20
    patterns:
      - "%SANDBOX%"
      - "%TEST%"
      # Add your dev/test schema patterns here

default:
  score: 50
  tier: "UNKNOWN"

risk_critical_patterns:
  - "%FINANCE%"
  - "%REVENUE%"
  # Add schemas that are critical to flag
```

**Customization:** Edit `config/schema-patterns.yaml` using SQL LIKE syntax (% = wildcard, case-insensitive). Example: `%ANALYTICS%` matches ANALYTICS, PROD_ANALYTICS, ANALYTICS_V2.

**Recursive Depth — defaults by workflow:**

| Workflow | Default distance | Templates |
|---|---|---|
| Impact Analysis (downstream) | 3 | `impact-analysis.sql`, `impact-analysis-users.sql` |
| Root Cause Analysis (upstream) | 3 | `root-cause-analysis.sql`, `change-detection.sql`, `root-cause-analysis-object-deps-fallback.sql` |
| Trust & Provenance | 3 | `provenance-verification.sql`, `provenance-verification-object-deps-fallback.sql` |
| Column Lineage (GET_LINEAGE) | 1 | `column-lineage-get-lineage.sql`, `column-lineage-full.sql` |
| Column Lineage (ACCESS_HISTORY fallback) | N/A — lookback days, not distance | `column-lineage-downstream.sql`, `column-lineage-upstream.sql` |

**Honoring user-specified depth:** Apply in this order:
1. **Explicit number** ("1 level", "2 hops", "3 levels deep", "just direct dependencies") → substitute that number as the distance, up to the maximum of 5.
2. **Relative "deeper"** ("go deeper", "show more", "dig deeper") with no explicit number → increment the current/default depth by 1, capped at 5.
3. **Maximum** ("show everything", "full lineage", "all levels", "maximum depth") → use 5.

In practice:
- In `GET_LINEAGE` templates: replace the `distance` argument with the resolved number.
- In recursive CTE fallback templates: replace `WHERE ul.level < N` with the resolved number.

**Retention:** ACCESS_HISTORY/QUERY_HISTORY: 365 days; GET_LINEAGE: current state; OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES: indefinite (latency on new objects).

---

## Known Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Workaround |
|------------|--------|------------|
| GET_LINEAGE max 5 levels | Deep chains truncated at 5 | Use OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES fallback for deeper traversal |
| ACCOUNT_USAGE latency (45min-3hr) | New objects missing from OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES | Use GET_LINEAGE first (current state); then GET_DDL() fallback |
| Column lineage depends on ACCESS_HISTORY | Not all queries expose column details | Confidence scores indicate reliability |
| Single account scope | Cross-account sharing not covered | Query each account separately |
| View DDL parsing | May miss dynamic SQL references | Review complex views manually |
| OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES = object dependency only | Data movement (e.g. CTAS, COPY) not in OBJECT_DEPENDENCIES | Use GET_LINEAGE as primary |
| Column lineage 90-day lookback | Older transformations not captured | Extend time range in templates |
| External-anchor queries not supported | Customer can't ask "what feeds this Power BI dashboard?" cold via SQL | Anchor on a connected Snowflake object; the external entity surfaces in the result for Horizon + Select Star Private Preview accounts |
| No `account_usage` view for external entities | Customer can't enumerate Horizon + Select Star entities directly | Browse Catalog Explorer in Snowsight, or walk outward from a known Snowflake-side object |
| No `ACCESS_HISTORY` for external entities | "Who uses this Power BI dashboard?" cannot be answered from Snowflake | Direct user to the external system |
