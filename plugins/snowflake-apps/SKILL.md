description: "Build and deploy web applications on Snowflake. Use for ALL app requests: create, scaffold, build, deploy, publish, develop, test, operate, monitor, or troubleshoot a Snowflake App. A Snowflake App is a web application (typically Next.js) deployed on Snowflake as an Application Service on Snowpark Container Services (SPCS). This is NOT a Streamlit app or Native App. Also load this skill when the user's current directory is a Snowflake App Runtime project: if the directory contains an `app.yml` file, or if it contains a `snowflake.yml` file with `type: snowflake-app` anywhere in it. Triggers: build me an app, new app, scaffold, web app, dashboard, data app, deploy my app, push to snowflake, ship it, deploy failed, fix deploy, run locally, develop, app logs, app status, restart app, app.yml, snowflake-app-runtime, snowflake-app, application service, show application services, alter application service."

# Snowflake Apps

This is the **routing skill** for building web applications on Snowflake. It detects the user's intent and directs you to the correct sub-skill for that phase of work. You **MUST** load the relevant sub-skill before doing any work — do NOT attempt app tasks using only the information on this page.

> A "Snowflake App" is a web application deployed on Snowflake as an Application Service on Snowpark Container Services (SPCS). It is **NOT** a Streamlit app or a Native App. If the user says "Snowflake App", "create an app", "build an app", "deploy my app", or "data app", use this skill.

> **For Streamlit-in-Snowflake apps** (Python projects deployed via `snow streamlit deploy`, visible in Snowsight under Streamlit Apps), use [`streamlit-in-snowflake/developing-with-streamlit-in-snowflake/`](../../streamlit-in-snowflake/developing-with-streamlit-in-snowflake/SKILL.md) instead. That skill covers the full create / develop / deploy / operate lifecycle for SiS — manifest shape, `snow streamlit deploy`, post-deploy `SHOW STREAMLITS` verification, local-preview troubleshooting, and `ALTER STREAMLIT` lifecycle SQL.

## Load the environment skill first

This skill describes *what* each phase does; a companion **environment skill** defines *how* to perform it where you're running:

- `snowflake-apps-desktop` — CoCo Desktop / CLI (full shell, the `snow` CLI, and `npm`).
- `snowflake-apps-workspace` — Snowsight workspace (SQL only; the filesystem is a stage mount).

Exactly one of these exists in any given environment. **If neither is already loaded, load the one available here now**, before doing any app work — the phase sub-skills below reference actions (scaffold, generate the manifest, deploy, run locally, operate) that only the environment skill knows how to carry out.

## Routing Table

Scan the user's full request and identify the matching intent. If the request spans multiple intents (e.g., create AND deploy), execute them sequentially — load each sub-skill before performing that phase of work.

| Intent | Triggers | Sub-Skill to Load |
|--------|----------|--------------------|
| **Create** — Scaffold a new app | "build me an app", "new app", "scaffold", "web app", "create an app", "start a new project", "build a dashboard", "data app", "data explorer" | `create/SKILL.md` |
| **Deploy** — Ship to Snowflake | "deploy my app", "push to snowflake", "ship it", "deploy", "publish", "deploy failed", "fix deploy", "redeploy" | `deploy/SKILL.md` |
| **Develop** — Local dev, test, iterate | "run locally", "develop", "iterate", "hot reload", "add a feature", "test my app", "run the dev server" | `develop/SKILL.md` |
| **Operate** — Post-deploy monitoring | "app logs", "why is my app down", "restart", "scale", "status", "rollback", "troubleshoot" | `operate/SKILL.md` |

**If the intent is ambiguous**, ask the user to clarify before proceeding.

## Typical User Journeys

Chain sub-skills to match the request:

- **New app:** Create → Develop → Deploy
- **Deploy an existing app:** Deploy
- **Iterate on a deployed app:** Develop → Deploy
- **Troubleshoot a running app:** Operate
- **Full lifecycle:** Create → Develop → Deploy → Operate

## Framework Scope

The `create` sub-skill scaffolds an app from a **self-contained template**. Templates live as subdirectories under `create/`, and more can be added over time across different languages and frameworks. Each template documents what it provides and how to build in it via its own `README.md`, so the sub-skills stay framework-agnostic and defer to the chosen template's README for code-level guidance.
