# Snowflake Apps Role Permissions

Required grants for a role to deploy and run Snowflake Apps. Run these as `SYSADMIN` or `SECURITYADMIN`.

The admin experience (`/settings/account/apps` in Snowsight) provisions infrastructure and sets account parameters that the CLI reads during setup. The platform defaults are:
- **Database**: `SNOWFLAKE_APPS`
- **Schema**: `PUBLIC`
- **Query warehouse**: `SNOWFLAKE_APPS_QUERY_WH`

Admins can change any of these defaults by setting account parameters (`DEFAULT_SNOWFLAKE_APPS_DESTINATION_DATABASE`, `DEFAULT_SNOWFLAKE_APPS_DESTINATION_SCHEMA`, `DEFAULT_SNOWFLAKE_APPS_QUERY_WAREHOUSE`, and others). See the parameter table in `references/debugging.md` for the full list.

After running `snow app setup`, all resolved values are written into `snowflake.yml`. That file is the source of truth for which database, schema, and warehouse the app is actually using. Before granting permissions, check `snowflake.yml` (specifically `identifier.database`, `identifier.schema`, and `query_warehouse`) to confirm the actual values, especially if the account has non-default configuration.

Compute pools, external access integrations, and image repositories are managed automatically by the platform. Replace `<ROLE>` with the target role name.

## Full Grant List

```sql
-- Replace <database>, <schema>, <warehouse> with values from snowflake.yml
-- (identifier.database, identifier.schema, query_warehouse).
-- Platform defaults: SNOWFLAKE_APPS / PUBLIC / SNOWFLAKE_APPS_QUERY_WH

-- Database and schema
GRANT USAGE ON DATABASE <database> TO ROLE <ROLE>;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA <database>.<schema> TO ROLE <ROLE>;
GRANT CREATE APPLICATION SERVICE ON SCHEMA <database>.<schema> TO ROLE <ROLE>;
GRANT CREATE ARTIFACT REPOSITORY ON SCHEMA <database>.<schema> TO ROLE <ROLE>;
GRANT CREATE STAGE ON SCHEMA <database>.<schema> TO ROLE <ROLE>;

-- Warehouse
GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE <warehouse> TO ROLE <ROLE>;
```

## Object Reference

| Object | Type | Privilege | Purpose |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| `<database>` | Database | `USAGE` | Access the apps database |
| `<database>.<schema>` | Schema | `USAGE` | Access the deployment schema |
| `<database>.<schema>` | Schema | `CREATE APPLICATION SERVICE` | Create app services during deploy |
| `<database>.<schema>` | Schema | `CREATE ARTIFACT REPOSITORY` | Create the artifact repository during deploy |
| `<database>.<schema>` | Schema | `CREATE STAGE` | Create and own the per-app code stage during deploy |
| `<warehouse>` | Warehouse | `USAGE` | Run queries during deployment |

## Post-Deploy Privileges

Grant these on a deployed application service to share access or delegate operations:

```sql
-- Allow another role to view the service in SHOW APPLICATION SERVICES and access its endpoint
GRANT USAGE ON APPLICATION SERVICE <database>.<schema>.<app_name> TO ROLE <ROLE>;

-- Allow another role to view logs and DESCRIBE
GRANT MONITOR ON APPLICATION SERVICE <database>.<schema>.<app_name> TO ROLE <ROLE>;

-- Allow another role to suspend, resume, upgrade, and alter properties
GRANT OPERATE ON APPLICATION SERVICE <database>.<schema>.<app_name> TO ROLE <ROLE>;

-- Allow another role to read/write the artifact repository (deploying role already has access as owner)
GRANT READ, WRITE ON ARTIFACT REPOSITORY <database>.<schema>.<repo_name> TO ROLE <ROLE>;
```

Privilege summary:

| Privilege | Enables |
|-----------|---------|
| `USAGE` | Visibility in `SHOW APPLICATION SERVICES`; access to the public endpoint URL |
| `MONITOR` | `DESCRIBE`, `SYSTEM$GET_APPLICATION_SERVICE_LOGS`, `SYSTEM$GET_APPLICATION_SERVICE_EVENT_TABLE_DATA` |
| `OPERATE` | `SUSPEND`, `RESUME`, `UPGRADE`, `ALTER SET/UNSET` |
| `OWNERSHIP` | All of the above plus `DROP` and `RENAME TO` |

## Notes

- `DATABASE` and `WAREHOUSE` grants require `SYSADMIN` or `SECURITYADMIN`. Schema and stage privileges can be granted by the role that owns the database/schema.
- The deploying role automatically owns any artifact repository it creates. `GRANT READ, WRITE ON ARTIFACT REPOSITORY` is for delegating access to other roles post-deploy; see Post-Deploy Privileges above.
- `CREATE STAGE` is required so the deploying role creates and owns the per-app code stage. If a code stage was previously created by a different role, drop it before redeploying so the publisher role can recreate it with correct ownership.
- **Role design:** `<ROLE>` should be a dedicated publisher role (e.g. `APP_PUBLISHER`). User roles should have `APP_PUBLISHER` granted as a secondary role rather than receiving these grants directly. Deploy using a connection with `APP_PUBLISHER` as the primary role and secondary roles disabled. This ensures all created objects (stages, services) are owned by `APP_PUBLISHER`, and SPCS owner's rights tokens in the running service resolve to that role.
