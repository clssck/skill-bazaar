# Incremental Refresh Operators Reference

Understanding which SQL operators support incremental refresh in Snowflake Dynamic Tables.

> **Note:** This guide uses INFORMATION_SCHEMA functions. See [monitoring-functions.md](monitoring-functions.md) for critical usage requirements (named parameters, database context).

## Why This Matters

When a dynamic table uses `REFRESH_MODE = INCREMENTAL`, Snowflake attempts to process only changed data. However, not all SQL operators support this optimization. If your query contains unsupported operators, Snowflake will either reject creation (for INCREMENTAL) or silently fall back to full refresh (for AUTO — which is why we never use AUTO).

**To check current refresh mode:**
```sql
SELECT name, refresh_mode, refresh_mode_reason
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLES(name=>'<dt_name>'));
```

## Operators That SUPPORT Incremental Refresh

These operators can process changes incrementally:

### Joins

| Operator | Incremental Support | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| `INNER JOIN` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `LEFT OUTER JOIN` | ✅ Yes | See restrictions below |
| `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` | ✅ Yes | See restrictions below |
| `FULL OUTER JOIN` | ✅ Yes | See restrictions below |
| `CROSS JOIN` | ✅ Yes | Supported |
| `NATURAL JOIN` | ✅ Yes | Supported |

**Outer Join Restrictions** - These patterns force FULL refresh:
- Non-equality predicates in the join condition (e.g., `ON a.id > b.id`)

### Set Operations

| Operator | Incremental Support | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| `UNION ALL` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `UNION` (distinct) | ⚠️ Partial | May require full refresh in some cases |

### Aggregations

| Operator | Incremental Support | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| `SUM()` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `COUNT()` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `AVG()` | ✅ Yes | Supported |
| `MIN()` | ✅ Yes | Supported |
| `MAX()` | ✅ Yes | Supported |
| `GROUP BY` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |

### Window Functions (Limited)

| Operator | Incremental Support | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| `ROW_NUMBER()` | ✅ Yes | Supported with PARTITION BY / ORDER BY |
| `RANK()` | ✅ Yes | Supported with PARTITION BY / ORDER BY |
| `LEAD()`/`LAG()` | ⚠️ Limited | May trigger full refresh |

### Other Operations

| Operator | Incremental Support | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| `WHERE` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `HAVING` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `CASE WHEN` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `COALESCE` | ✅ Yes | Fully supported |
| `DISTINCT` | ⚠️ Partial | May require full refresh |
| Subqueries (scalar) | ✅ Yes | Generally supported |
| `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT ...)` | ❌ No | Error 091927 — subquery expressions not supported for CT |
| `WHERE IN (SELECT ...)` | ❌ No | Error 091927 — subquery expressions not supported for CT |

---

## Operators That REQUIRE Full Refresh

These operators **cannot** be processed incrementally:

### Outer Join Patterns

| Pattern | Why Not Supported |
|---------|-------------------|
| Outer join with non-equality predicate | ❌ e.g., `ON a.id > b.id` or `ON a.val <> b.val` |

### Set Operations

| Operator | Why Not Supported |
|----------|-------------------|
| `EXCEPT` | ❌ Requires comparing entire datasets |
| `INTERSECT` | ❌ Requires comparing entire datasets |
| `MINUS` | ❌ Same as EXCEPT |

### Table Functions

| Operator | Incremental Support | Notes |
|----------|-------------------|-------|
| `LATERAL FLATTEN` | ✅ Yes | Supported for semi-structured data |
| `LATERAL` (other) | ❌ No | Complex row generation not supported |
| `TABLE()` functions | ⚠️ Partial | Depends on function |

### Non-Deterministic Functions

| Function | Why Not Supported |
|----------|-------------------|
| `RANDOM()` | ❌ Different value on each refresh |
| `UUID_STRING()` | ❌ Generates new value each time |
| `SEQ*()` sequences | ❌ Not reproducible |

**Exception:** `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, `CURRENT_DATE()`, `SYSDATE()` are supported in incremental mode **only when used in filters (WHERE clause)**. Using them in projections (SELECT list) forces FULL refresh because the value changes on every refresh, making rows non-reproducible.

## Common refresh_mode_reason Values

When Snowflake cannot use incremental refresh, the `refresh_mode_reason` column explains why:

| Reason | Meaning | Fix |
|--------|---------|-----|
| `QUERY_NOT_SUPPORTED_FOR_INCREMENTAL` | Query uses unsupported constructs | Restructure query or use FULL |
| `USER_SPECIFIED_FULL_REFRESH` | Created with REFRESH_MODE = FULL | Recreate with INCREMENTAL if operators allow |
| `UPSTREAM_USES_FULL_REFRESH` | Upstream DT uses FULL mode | Fix upstream DT first |
| `CHANGE_TRACKING_NOT_ENABLED` | Base table missing change tracking | Enable change tracking |
| `NO_INCREMENTAL_MAINTENANCE_SUPPORT` | Internal limitation | Use FULL refresh |

---

## Converting Full to Incremental

### FULL OUTER JOIN → Alternative Pattern

**Before (requires FULL refresh):**
```sql
SELECT COALESCE(a.id, b.id) as id, a.val1, b.val2
FROM table_a a
FULL OUTER JOIN table_b b ON a.id = b.id
```

**After (supports INCREMENTAL):**
```sql
SELECT a.id, a.val1, b.val2
FROM table_a a
LEFT JOIN table_b b ON a.id = b.id
UNION ALL
SELECT b.id, NULL as val1, b.val2
FROM table_b b
WHERE NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM table_a a WHERE a.id = b.id)
```

### EXCEPT → LEFT ANTI JOIN

**Before:**
```sql
SELECT id FROM table_a
EXCEPT
SELECT id FROM table_b
```

**After:**
```sql
SELECT a.id
FROM table_a a
LEFT JOIN table_b b ON a.id = b.id
WHERE b.id IS NULL
```

### Complex Window Functions → Intermediate DT

**Before (single complex DT):**
```sql
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE final AS
SELECT *,
  LEAD(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer ORDER BY date) as next_amount,
  LAG(amount) OVER (PARTITION BY customer ORDER BY date) as prev_amount
FROM orders
```

**After (decomposed):**
```sql
-- Intermediate DT with base data (INCREMENTAL-safe passthrough)
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE staging.orders_enriched
  WAREHOUSE = transform_wh
  REFRESH_MODE = INCREMENTAL
  SCHEDULER = 'DISABLE'
  AS SELECT * FROM orders;

-- Final DT with window functions (must be FULL)
CREATE DYNAMIC TABLE final
  WAREHOUSE = transform_wh
  REFRESH_MODE = FULL
  SCHEDULER = 'DISABLE'
  AS SELECT *,
    LEAD(amount) OVER (...) as next_amount,
    LAG(amount) OVER (...) as prev_amount
  FROM staging.orders_enriched;
```

## Checking If Your Query Supports Incremental

After creating a DT with an explicit `refresh_mode`, verify it wasn't silently downgraded:

```sql
SELECT name, refresh_mode, refresh_mode_reason
FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.DYNAMIC_TABLES(name=>'<dt_name>'));
```

If `refresh_mode_reason` is non-NULL, Snowflake overrode your choice — check the reason and classify accordingly.

## Best Practices

1. **Always set explicit refresh_mode** — never use `AUTO` (it silently falls back to FULL without warning)
2. **Check refresh_mode_reason** — understand why FULL is being used if unexpected
3. **Avoid unsupported constructs** — restructure if incremental is important
4. **Decompose complex queries** — split into intermediate DTs
5. **Accept FULL when appropriate** — some queries genuinely need full refresh
6. **Use `scheduler='disable'`** — manage refresh scheduling externally via dbt
