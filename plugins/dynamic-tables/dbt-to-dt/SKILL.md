description: "Convert dbt table models to Snowflake Dynamic Tables. Two stages: Stage 1 converts to FULL DT (quick, safe). Stage 2 upgrades eligible FULL DTs to INCREMENTAL (iterative, per-layer). Use when: migrate dbt to DT, convert dbt models to dynamic tables, dbt materialized dynamic_table, table to DT migration, make models incremental."

# dbt-to-dt — Router

Detects user intent and routes to the appropriate sub-skill.

## Applicability check

This skill is for **dbt projects** being migrated to Dynamic Tables. If there is no dbt project in the user's working directory (no `dbt_project.yml`), this skill does not apply — fall back to the parent `dynamic-tables` skill's OPTIMIZE intent instead.

## Routing

| User intent | Route to |
|-------------|----------|
| "Convert my dbt models to DTs" / "migrate to dynamic tables" / first-time migration | `stage-1/SKILL.md` |
| "Can this model be a DT?" / pastes single SQL / "classify this model" | `advisor/SKILL.md` |
| "Upgrade FULL DTs to INC" / "check shadow results" / "next INC layer" / "optimize my DTs" | `stage-2/SKILL.md` |
| "What's the status of my migration?" | Check `<dbt_project>/.dt-migration/` artifacts and report current state |

## Key Concept: Two-Stage Migration

**Stage 1 — CTAS → FULL DT (quick win):**
- Converts `materialized='table'` to `materialized='dynamic_table'` with `refresh_mode='full'`
- No change tracking needed, no cascade analysis, no operator classification
- Only DDL blockers matter (UUID_STRING, RANDOM, WITH RECURSIVE, UNPIVOT, SAMPLE)
- Lightweight validation: sample-and-compare per model

**Stage 2 — FULL DT → INC upgrade (iterative):**
- Upgrades individual FULL DTs to `refresh_mode='incremental'` where safe
- One topological layer at a time (upstream first)
- Shadow + Observe + Promote pattern (create INC shadow, wait N days, compare, promote via dbt)
- User invokes repeatedly — each run handles one layer

## Architecture: scheduler='disable'

All converted DTs use `scheduler='disable'`. dbt remains the orchestrator — refreshes happen on each `dbt run` via `ALTER DYNAMIC TABLE ... REFRESH`. No TARGET_LAG.

Stage 2 additionally loads:
