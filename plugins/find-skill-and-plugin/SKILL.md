name: find-skill-and-plugin
description: >-
  Find, add, check, or update Cortex Code catalog skills and plugins before
  using them. Use when the user asks to search "the catalog" (even without
  specifying skill or plugin), discover available skills or plugins, install a
  catalog skill or plugin, make an uninstalled `/skill` or `$skill` usable,
  search the skill or plugin marketplace/catalog, check whether installed
  skills or plugins have updates, or update skills and plugins from the
  catalog, stage, GitHub, or tarball sources. Do not use this for public
  Snowflake Marketplace datasets or apps; use marketplace-search for
  third-party data/product listings.

# Find Skill and Plugin

Use this skill to discover Cortex Code skills and plugins from the catalog and
make them available locally before invoking them.

## Workflow

**Before doing anything**, read the user's request and pick exactly one path:

| What the user said | Path to follow |
|--------------------|----------------|
| Mentions "skill" (e.g. "find a skill", "install skill") | **Skill Workflow only** — do NOT run `cortex plugin find` |
| Mentions "plugin" (e.g. "find a plugin", "add plugin") | **Plugin Workflow only** — do NOT run `cortex skill find` |
| Provides a bare FQN or `snow://skill_catalog/…` URI | **Bare FQN Workflow** — determine type first, then install with ONE command |
| Neither "skill" nor "plugin" | **Search Both** — run both commands, let user choose |

Do not deviate from the chosen path. If the user said "skill", skip the plugin
search entirely, even if plugin results might also be relevant.

---

### Skill Workflow

1. Search for candidate skills:

```bash
cortex skill find "<query>"
```

Use a short query based on the capability the user needs. If the user named a
specific saved Snowflake connection, pass `--connection <name>`.

If the first query returns no results, retry with 2–3 broader or synonym
queries before giving up. For example, if `"data governance access patterns"`
fails, try `"governance"`, `"access history"`, `"audit"`. Decompose
multi-word phrases into their most distinctive single term. Only move to the
plugin fallback after exhausting reasonable query variations.

1a. **If no skills are found after trying multiple queries**, run the plugin search as a fallback:

```bash
cortex plugin find "<query>"
```

If the plugin results look relevant, ask the user before proceeding:
> "I didn't find any skills matching that query, but I found these plugins —
> would you like to install one of them instead?"
Only continue if the user confirms. If the plugin search also returns nothing,
report that no results were found for either type.

2. Choose by the catalog result's name, description, source, and plugin FQN.
Do not rely on the catalog object's SQL name alone; a Cortex Extension object
name can differ from the actual `name` in `SKILL.md`.

3. Install the selected skill before trying to invoke it. Prefer the exact
command printed by `cortex skill find`; it preserves important options such as
`--connection`. Some catalog **skills** are delivered by a backing Cortex
Extension, in which case the install command carries the extension FQN via
`--plugin-fqn`:

```bash
cortex skill add <catalog-name> --plugin-fqn '<DB.SCHEMA.CORTEX_EXTENSION>'
```

⚠️ `--plugin-fqn` does **not** mean "install a plugin." It is only correct when
the catalog object is a **skill** (Cortex Extension `type = SKILL`). A genuine
**plugin** (`type = PLUGIN`) must be installed through the **Plugin Workflow**
with `cortex plugin add '<FQN>'` — never `cortex skill add`. A plugin FQN such
as `USER$SHSEN.SKILL_SHARING.COCO_JIRA` looks identical to a skill's backing
extension FQN, so if you reached this step from a `cortex plugin find` result,
or you are not certain the object is a skill, first confirm the type — see
[Determining artifact type from an FQN or URI](#determining-artifact-type-from-an-fqn-or-uri).

Always wrap the FQN in single quotes. FQNs can contain `$` (e.g.
`USER$ALICE.SKILL_SHARING.MY_SKILL`) which the shell interprets as a variable
without quoting.

If the user provided a share URI directly, install it as-is:

```bash
cortex skill add 'snow://skill_catalog/<DB>.<SCHEMA>.<CORTEX_EXTENSION>'
```

4. Confirm the installed skill name:

```bash
cortex skill list
```

Use the installed skill's real `SKILL.md` name for future `$skill` or `/skill`
references. The install output and `cortex skill list` are authoritative.

5. If the user needs the newly installed skill used in the same turn, inspect
the installed skill's `SKILL.md` from the listed path and follow its
instructions directly. A running agent may not auto-load a skill that was
installed after the prompt was parsed, so do not assume `$skill` or `/skill`
will resolve until a later turn.

If the user is testing from a source checkout and provides a CLI prefix such as
`bun run dev --`, use that prefix consistently in place of `cortex`.

---

### Plugin Workflow

1. Search for candidate plugins:

```bash
cortex plugin find "<query>"
```

1a. **If no plugins are found**, run the skill search as a fallback:

```bash
cortex skill find "<query>"
```

If the skill results look relevant, ask the user before proceeding:
> "I didn't find any plugins matching that query, but I found these skills —
> would you like to install one of them instead?"
Only continue if the user confirms. If the skill search also returns nothing,
report that no results were found for either type.

2. Choose a plugin from the results by name, description, and FQN (e.g.
`MISSION_CONTROL.APPS.AGENT_MODE`). If no result is an exact name match,
choose the best candidate based on description relevance, present it to the
user with a one-line justification (e.g. "Installing `release-ops` — it
handles release automation workflows, which matches your request"), and
proceed to install unless the user objects.

3. Install the selected plugin by FQN, wrapped in single quotes:

```bash
cortex plugin add 'MISSION_CONTROL.APPS.AGENT_MODE'
```

Always wrap the FQN in single quotes. FQNs can contain `$` (e.g.
`USER$ALICE.SKILL_SHARING.NOVA`) which the shell interprets as a variable
without quoting.

4. Confirm the installed plugin:

```bash
cortex plugin list
```

5. Check a specific plugin by name:

```bash
cortex plugin check agent-mode
```

---

### Bare FQN or URI Workflow

Use this path when the user provides a Cortex Extension FQN
(e.g. `USER$ALICE.SKILL_SHARING.COST_ADVISOR`) or a
`snow://skill_catalog/<DB>.<SCHEMA>.<NAME>` URI without stating whether it is a
skill or a plugin. The FQN shape is identical for both types — do not guess.

1. **Determine the type** by describing the extension:

```bash
cortex sql -q "DESCRIBE CORTEX EXTENSION <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<NAME>"
```

Read the `type` column in the output.

If `DESCRIBE` is unavailable or fails, fall back to searching both catalogs and
matching the FQN against the results:

```bash
cortex skill find "<name>"
cortex plugin find "<name>"
```

Whichever search returns a result whose FQN matches → that is the type.

If `DESCRIBE` fails **and** neither catalog search returns a result matching the
FQN, the object cannot be found. **Stop and tell the user** the artifact was not
found — do not attempt to install it. Never try both install commands as a
fallback when the type cannot be determined.

2. **Install using exactly one command** based on the resolved type:

- `type = SKILL` → install via the Skill Workflow:
  ```bash
  cortex skill add <catalog-name> --plugin-fqn '<DB.SCHEMA.NAME>'
  ```

- `type = PLUGIN` → install via the Plugin Workflow:
  ```bash
  cortex plugin add '<DB.SCHEMA.NAME>'
  ```

⚠️ **Never run both `cortex skill add` and `cortex plugin add` on the same
FQN.** Once you have determined the type, commit to exactly one install command
and stop. Trying both is incorrect regardless of which one succeeds.

---

### Search Both (default)

Only use this path when the user's request mentions neither "skill" nor "plugin"
and did not provide a bare FQN or URI.

Run both searches and present results clearly labelled by type before installing:

```bash
cortex skill find "<query>"
cortex plugin find "<query>"
```

Then let the user choose, and follow the appropriate Skill Workflow or Plugin
Workflow above to install.

---

## Determining artifact type from an FQN or URI

When the user hands you a bare Cortex Extension FQN or a
`snow://skill_catalog/<DB>.<SCHEMA>.<NAME>` URI (or when a search surfaced an
FQN but you are unsure whether it is a skill or a plugin), determine the type
**before** installing. The FQN shape is identical for skills and plugins, so you
cannot tell from the name alone — an object in `SKILL_SHARING` is not
necessarily a skill.

Describe the extension over the connection and read the `type` column:

```bash
cortex sql -q "DESCRIBE CORTEX EXTENSION <DB>.<SCHEMA>.<NAME>"
```

(Or run the SQL through whatever connection the user is using; pass
`--connection <name>` if they named a saved connection.)

- `type = SKILL` → install via the **Skill Workflow**
  (`cortex skill add … [--plugin-fqn '<FQN>']`).
- `type = PLUGIN` → install via the **Plugin Workflow**
  (`cortex plugin add '<FQN>'`).

If `DESCRIBE` is unavailable, fall back to searching: run `cortex plugin find`
and `cortex skill find` and match the FQN against the results to see which
command reports it. Do not guess the type from the schema or object name.

---

## Updates

### Skills

Check installed remote, stage, tarball, and catalog skills:

```bash
cortex skill check
```

Check one source or skill:

```bash
cortex skill check <skill-or-source>
```

Update an installed skill with the command shown by `check`, or use the
appropriate source form:

```bash
cortex skill update <skill-or-source>
cortex skill update <skill-name> --plugin-fqn <DB.SCHEMA.CORTEX_EXTENSION>
```

### Plugins

Check a specific installed plugin:

```bash
cortex plugin check <plugin-name>
```

## Snowsight Sandbox

In a Snowsight sandbox session, export both env vars once per session
before running any `cortex skill` command, so installed skills and
`skills.json` persist in the workspace volume instead of the ephemeral
home directory:

```bash
export CORTEX_HOME=/workspace/.snowflake
export SKILL_DIR=/workspace/.snowflake/cortex/skills
```

### Troubleshooting

If `cortex skill add` reports success but the new skill is missing from
`cortex skill list` or absent from `skills.json`, the env vars are set in
only one of the two processes (the CoCo UI vs. the spawned subprocess).
Confirm both are exported in both environments, then re-run.

## Guardrails

- Do not tell the user to use an uninstalled catalog skill with `$skill` or
  `/skill`; install it first.
- Do not assume the catalog SQL object name equals the installed skill name.
- Do not edit `SKILL.md` metadata to force a name match during install; preserve
  the publisher's bundle and use the actual installed skill name.
- Do not use this skill for public Snowflake Marketplace datasets, Native Apps,
  or connectors; use `marketplace-search`.
- When the user explicitly says "skill", use only `cortex skill find` / `cortex skill add`; do not search plugins.
- When the user explicitly says "plugin", use only `cortex plugin find` / `cortex plugin add`; do not search skills.
- When neither is specified, always run both `cortex skill find` and `cortex plugin find` and present combined results before installing.
- Never install a plugin with `cortex skill add`. A result from `cortex plugin find`, or any Cortex Extension with `type = PLUGIN`, is installed with `cortex plugin add '<FQN>'`. The `--plugin-fqn` flag on `cortex skill add` is only for skills backed by an extension (`type = SKILL`), not for plugins.
- When given a bare FQN or `snow://skill_catalog/...` URI whose type is unknown, determine the type first (see [Determining artifact type from an FQN or URI](#determining-artifact-type-from-an-fqn-or-uri)) instead of assuming skill.
- Never run both `cortex skill add` and `cortex plugin add` on the same FQN. Pick the correct command based on the resolved type and stop.
