# Fixer Agent — Phase 2 Specialist

Apply code fixes for SCOS compatibility issues identified in `analysis.json` for Scala workloads.

## Inputs

Read `migration_state.json` to get:
- `manifest` — list of `.scala` files
- `migrated_dir` — directory with copied source files
- `conversion_root` — for `analysis.json` and gate file

Read `analysis.json` from the conversion root.

The coordinator passes these per-dispatch context parameters:
- `CHUNK_MODE=chunked`, `CHUNK_ID=<n>`, `CHUNK_FILES=<comma-separated files>` —
  process **only** the files in `CHUNK_FILES`, not the whole manifest.
- `PARALLEL_MODE=true|false` — when `true`, you are one of several fixers
  running concurrently in a wave. **Do NOT write `migration_state.json`** (the
  coordinator is the single writer and concurrent writes would race); instead
  return a `CHUNK_RESULT` line (see Output). When `false` (or absent), you may
  update state yourself as the sole writer.

## Rules

Load `references/fix-rules.md` for the complete Scala-specific fix rule set. Key rules summary:

| Risk | Action |
|------|--------|
| `final_risk >= 0.7` | **Must fix** — apply fix or rewrite. If impossible, add `// SCOS: TODO`. If genuinely safe, record `resolution: "safe"` with a concrete `resolution_reason` in `analysis.json`. |
| `0.3 <= final_risk < 0.7` | **Should fix** — apply fix if suggested, else `// SCOS: TODO`. If genuinely safe, record `resolution: "safe"` in `analysis.json`. |
| `final_risk < 0.3` | **Review** — fix if possible, else record `resolution: "safe"` in `analysis.json` (no inline comment) or leave a brief `// SCOS: <explanation>`. |

Every issue ends with a verdict: an inline `// SCOS:` comment **or** a
`resolution` field on the issue object in `analysis.json` (see
`references/fix-rules.md` → "Recording resolutions in `analysis.json`"). A
recorded `resolution` (`fixed`/`safe`/`todo`/`perf`) satisfies the Phase-2
high-risk coverage gate without an inline marker — `resolution: "safe"` requires
a non-empty `resolution_reason`. This is the same verdict model PySpark uses.

**Critical exceptions (do NOT annotate):**
- No-op operations (`hint()`, `repartition()`, `coalesce()`) — leave as-is, no comment
- No-op configs (`spark.sql.shuffle.partitions`, `spark.executor.memory`, etc.) — leave as-is, no comment

**Comment prefixes (Scala uses `//` not `#`):**
- `// SCOS: <explanation>` — fix applied or reviewed
- `// SCOS: [SPRKCNTSCL####] <explanation>` — fix/annotation carrying its EWI code (embed the code inline, exactly as PySpark does with `# SCOS: [SPRKCNTPY####]`)
- `// SCOS: TODO - <explanation>` — requires manual review
- `// SCOS: Performance tip - <explanation>` — optimization recommendation

> **Single marker vocabulary (parity with PySpark).** Every inline annotation
> you leave uses the `// SCOS:` prefix — there is **no** separate `// EWI:`
> prefix. When an EWI code applies (e.g. an unsupported API), embed it as a
> `[SPRKCNTSCL####]` token inside the `// SCOS:` comment. The Phase-2 coverage
> gate (`verify_phase.py`) confirms a `// SCOS` marker sits within ±3 lines of
> each high-risk issue's line range, **or** that the issue carries a recognized
> `resolution` verdict (`fixed`/`safe`/`todo`/`perf`) in `analysis.json`
> (`resolution: "safe"` additionally requires a `resolution_reason`). A bare
> `// EWI:` line is still accepted for backward-compat, but new output MUST use
> the `// SCOS: [SPRKCNTSCL####]` form.

### MUST NOT undo deterministic pre-processing (binding)

Phase 0.5 (the sole deterministic tier — AST-grade Scalafix rules) already
applied byte-perfect rewrites before you ran. You **MUST NOT** modify, collapse,
re-order, or delete any AST-managed region. Specifically:

- **Never touch a line carrying a recipe marker comment** — `// SCOS-RECIPE-PRESERVED-CONFIG: <k>=<v>`, `// SCOS-RECIPE-INSERT-AFTER-BUILDER: ...`, `// SCOS-RECIPE-INSERT-IMPORT: <class>`, or any `// SCOS-WARN:` / `// SCOS-TODO:` emitted by a Scalafix rule — and never remove the `.config(...)` / `.conf.set(...)` line it guards. `// SCOS-RECIPE-INSERT-IMPORT:` lines are consumed by Phase 3 (`update_imports_scala.py`) to inject the corresponding import statement; removing them prevents the import from being added. Collapsing a `SparkSession`/`SnowparkConnectSession` builder chain and silently dropping a preserved `spark.sql.session.timeZone` (or any other preserved config) is the canonical regression this rule prevents.
- **Treat `migration_state.json :: recipe_edits` as off-limits.** Any `file:line` with a `recipe_edits` anchor (its `recipe_id` is in the `scalafix:<RuleName>` namespace) was already handled deterministically — do not re-flag, re-rewrite, or revert it. If an `analysis.json` issue points at an AST-managed line, assume it is already fixed and skip it.
- If you believe an AST-managed region is wrong, add a `// SCOS: TODO - recipe region needs review` comment **above** it — do not edit the region itself.

The Phase 2 verifier (`verify_phase.py --phase 2`) asserts the recipe markers
you were given still survive (you did not delete a preserve-config region);
dropping one is a hard gate failure. Phase 3 then verifies the config is
actually materialized after the session is rebuilt.

## Workflow

Process files **one at a time** from the manifest:

1. Read the file
2. Find all issues for this file in `analysis.json`
3. For each issue, consult `references/fix-rules.md` for the appropriate action:
   - **`spark.sparkContext` → typed null stub** — `SnowparkConnectSession` has no
     `sparkContext` method. When `lazy val sc = spark.sparkContext` appears in a
     shared singleton (e.g. `ETL.scala`), replace it with a compilation-safe stub
     so the compile gate passes and downstream callers still reference a typed
     value:
     ```scala
     // SCOS: [SPRKCNTSCL1500] SparkContext not available in SCOS — stub for compilation; remove all sc.xxx usages
     lazy val sc: org.apache.spark.SparkContext = null.asInstanceOf[org.apache.spark.SparkContext]
     ```
   - **Dead imports from spark-core internals** — `org.apache.spark.metrics.UserMetricsSystems`
     and similar internal Spark classes are absent from `spark-connect-client-jvm`.
     If the symbol is imported but never referenced in the file body, remove the
     import entirely and leave a `// SCOS:` comment in its place:
     ```scala
     // SCOS: removed unused import org.apache.spark.metrics.UserMetricsSystems (spark-core internal, not in SCOS classpath)
     ```
     Do NOT add these as TODO markers — they are unused dead code, not actionable migration work.
   - **RDD operations**: Read `../../references/scala/rdd-conversion.md`. Check the issue's `"unsupported"` flag and the `"fix"` text: if `unsupported: true` (`.rdd` with closure or partition op, `mapPartitions`/`foreachPartition`, SparkContext file/accumulator APIs) **preserve the line and prepend a `// SCOS: [SPRKCNTSCL1500] … manual refactor required` marker — do NOT rewrite or fabricate** (keep the literal `manual refactor` phrase so the Phase 2b compile gate quarantines the file instead of reverting it); if `unsupported: false` and the fix mentions "drop the .rdd accessor" — drop the `.rdd` hop and call the same method on the DataFrame directly (`df.rdd.count()` → `df.count()`, `df1.rdd.union(df2.rdd)` → `df1.union(df2)`, `df.rdd.distinct()` → `df.distinct()`, etc. — see rdd-conversion.md Bucket B); if `unsupported: false` and the pattern is `sc.parallelize`/`sc.emptyRDD` or a `*ByKey` pair op — rewrite to `createDataFrame`/`groupBy().agg(...)` using the canonical forms; if `sc.broadcast(v)` — use `v` directly or `df.hint("broadcast")` for a join hint. **Never** wrap tuples in `Tuple1`, **never** nest `createDataFrame`, **never** re-introduce `.rdd` to force compilation.
   - **Delta format reads/writes (Rule 7b — must fix)**: `.format("delta").load(path)` → `spark.read.table("<table_name>")`. `.format("delta").save(path)`, `.write.parquet(path)`, and `.write.save(path)` → `.write.mode("overwrite").saveAsTable("<table_name>")`. Infer the table name from the last meaningful path segment. This is `final_risk >= 0.9` — do NOT leave a TODO. See fix-rules.md Rule 7b for examples.
   - **`sys.env` calls (Phase 3 handled — verify only)**: `sys.env.getOrElse("K","d")` / `sys.env("K")` / `sys.env.get("K")` are rewritten deterministically to `System.getProperty(...)` by Phase 3 (`update_imports_scala.py`). If you encounter any surviving `sys.env` call (Phase 3 was skipped or missed it), rewrite it yourself: `sys.env.getOrElse("K","d")` → `System.getProperty("K","d")`, `sys.env("K")` → `System.getProperty("K")`, `sys.env.get("K")` → `Option(System.getProperty("K"))`.
   - **UDF serialization**: Read `../../references/scala/udf-dependencies.md` for Scala-specific fixes (REPLClassDirMonitor, addArtifact, staged JARs)
   - **Wildcard file reads**: Replace with explicit file lists or add TODO
   - **`checkpoint()`**: Replace with `cache()`
   - **Map column subscript**: Replace `mapCol(col("key"))` with `element_at(mapCol, col("key"))`
   - **Catalyst imports**: Create local case class replacements (Rule 15)
   - **Hadoop/HDFS**: Remove imports, replace file ops with Snowflake stage/table (Rule 16)
   - **HWC**: Replace `hive.sql()` → `spark.sql()`, remove HWC declarations (Rule 17)
   - **Hive DDL**: Comment out with TODO (Rule 18)
   - **Cross-file consistency**: After any signature change, grep entire codebase for callers (Rule 20)
   - **Import emission**: Only emit valid Scala import lines — no trailing text/em-dashes (Rule 21)
   - **Syntax artifact cleanup**: Clean up trailing text, bare em-dashes, orphaned comments (Rule 22)
   - **Databricks survivors scan (Rule 16c — MANDATORY)**: After all edits, run the survivor scan from **Rule 16c in `references/fix-rules.md`** and add a `// SCOS: [SPRKCNTSCL1100]` annotation above every unannotated `com.databricks` / `dbutils` line. Any line without a `// SCOS:` or `// EWI:` annotation above it is a hard failure in the Tier 2 test suite.
4. Apply fixes using the Edit tool
5. Record per-file progress:
   - **`PARALLEL_MODE=true`**: do NOT write `migration_state.json`. Accumulate
     the files you completed and report them in the `CHUNK_RESULT` line (Output).
     The coordinator merges every wave member's result into state once.
   - **`PARALLEL_MODE=false`/absent**: update `migration_state.json` yourself:
     ```json
     "2_fixes": {"files_done": ["File1.scala"], "files_remaining": ["File2.scala"]}
     ```

## Phase 2b Compile Gate Notes

- **Mask before the gate.** `notebooks/*.scala` (top-level expressions) and
  `project/*.scala` (sbt meta, `import sbt._`) cause cascade `expected class or
  object definition` errors that misattribute to every file. Rename them to
  `*.scala.nb` before running `revert_failing_scala_files.py` and restore
  immediately after.
- **sbt fallback.** When the project has deps beyond `spark-connect-client-jvm`
  (e.g. `dbutils-api`, local `lib/` JARs), standalone `scalac` fails on every
  file. Run `sbt compile` in `<MIGRATED>` instead — sbt reads `build.sbt` and
  resolves the full classpath, and naturally excludes notebooks and
  `project/` files. Record `"compile_tool": "sbt compile"` in Phase 2b state.

## Completeness Check

After processing all files:
- Every issue in `analysis.json` with `final_risk >= 0.7` has a fix, a `// SCOS:`/`// SCOS: TODO` marker within ±3 lines of its `lines` range, **or** a recognized `resolution` verdict (`resolution: "safe"` **with** a `resolution_reason`)
- Every issue with `final_risk >= 0.3` has a fix, comment/TODO, or a `resolution` verdict
- Cross-file consistency verified (Rule 20) — no calls to removed methods/parameters remain
- File count matches manifest

Report: "Fixes applied: X files processed, Y issues fixed, Z TODOs remaining"

## Output

- Modified files in `<MIGRATED>/`
- **`PARALLEL_MODE=true`**: return a single `CHUNK_RESULT` line for the coordinator
  to merge — do NOT write `migration_state.json`:
  ```
  CHUNK_RESULT chunk_id=<n> files_done=File1.scala,File2.scala todos=<count>
  ```
- **`PARALLEL_MODE=false`/absent**: updated `migration_state.json` with phase 2 status.

## Notebook File Handling

When a manifest entry is a notebook (any format recognised by `notebook_io` —
`.ipynb`, Databricks-native `.python`/`.scala`/`.sql`, Databricks exported
`.py`/`.scala`):

1. Parse the notebook via the shared module (never hand-roll `json.load`):
   ```python
   import sys
   sys.path.insert(0, '<SKILL_DIRECTORY>/scripts')
   from notebook_io import parse_notebook, write_notebook
   nb = parse_notebook(path)
   ```
2. Iterate `nb.cells`. For each cell:
   - If `cell.cell_type == "markdown"` or `cell.cell_language in {"sql", "r", "shell", "fs", "run"}` → leave untouched.
   - If `cell.cell_language == "scala"` → apply the Scala fix rules (same as for `.scala` files) to `cell.source`, mutating `cell.source` in place.
   - If `cell.cell_language == "python"` → **cross-language delegation**, see below.
3. After processing every cell, serialize with `write_notebook(path, nb)`.

## Cross-Language Delegation

Notebooks frequently contain cells in a minority language (e.g. a `%python`
cell inside a Scala-primary notebook). Cross-language notebooks are detected
at Phase 0 via `notebook_index.code_cells_by_language`; when any notebook has
cells in more than one of `{python, scala}`, BOTH `analyze_pyspark.py` and
`analyze_scala.py` must run in Phase 1 and their outputs merged into
`analysis.json`. Each issue row carries a `language` field identifying the
owning analyzer.

For every `cell.cell_language == "python"` cell encountered during step 2
above:

1. Capture the cell's source and pre-select matching issues from
   `analysis.json` where **all** of:
   - `file == <notebook path>` (same notebook)
   - `cell_id == cell.index` (same cell)
   - `language == "python"` (only issues the Python analyzer produced)
   If no such issues exist after cross-language analysis ran, the cell has no
   known Python-language migration work — emit a passthrough and move on
   (do NOT delegate to CELL_MODE in this case).
2. Delegate to the sibling sub-skill's fixer via `task()`:
   ```
   task(
     subagent_type="general-purpose",
     description="Fix single Python cell",
     prompt="<content of migrate-pyspark-to-snowpark-connect/agents/fixer.md>\n\n"
            "CELL_MODE=true\n"
            "CELL_SOURCE=<cell.source>\n"
            "CELL_ISSUES=<subset of analysis.json matching this cell AND language=='python'>\n"
   )
   ```
3. The Python fixer returns the transformed cell source as its final textual
   output. Splice the returned source back into `cell.source`. If the return
   value is empty or malformed, leave the cell unchanged and log a
   `// SCOS: SKIPPED - python delegation failed` comment at the top of the cell.
4. EWI namespace for the delegated cell: `SPRKCNTPY*` (the cell's language
   determines the EWI namespace, not the notebook's primary language).

## CELL_MODE (When This Fixer Is Called From the Python Sub-Skill)

If your prompt context sets `CELL_MODE=true`, you are being invoked by the
Python sub-skill to fix a single Scala cell:

- Read `CELL_SOURCE` and `CELL_ISSUES` from the context. `CELL_ISSUES` has
  already been pre-filtered by the caller to contain only issues where
  `language == "scala"` and `cell_id` matches this cell — trust that filter
  and do not re-query `analysis.json`.
- If `CELL_ISSUES` is empty, output `CELL_SOURCE` unchanged (no known Scala
  work to do on this cell) — this path is expected when no Scala issues were
  found by `analyze_scala.py` for this cell.
- Apply the Scala fix rules to `CELL_SOURCE` (same rules as step 3 above),
  but do NOT write any files — operate on the string in memory.
- Output ONLY the transformed cell source as your final textual response.
  Do not wrap in code fences or emit any other text. The calling Python
  fixer splices your output verbatim back into its notebook.
- Do NOT read `migration_state.json`, `analysis.json`, or any other file.
  The calling agent has already pre-selected the issues relevant to this cell.
