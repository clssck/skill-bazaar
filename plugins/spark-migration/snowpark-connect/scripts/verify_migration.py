"""Evidence-based verification of per-file migration status.

The fixer agent self-reports completion in ``migration_state.json``
(``processed_files`` / ``files_done``), and ``fallback_transform.py`` stamps a
``SPRKCNTPY0099`` "Partial Migration" finding on whatever it deems
unprocessed. Neither signal is verified against the migrated output, so a
file can be recorded "done" without a real migration, or flagged "partial"
after a successful one (the SNOW-3383532 fallback key-mismatch bug).

This module cross-checks the self-reported state against objective,
deterministic evidence read from the migrated files themselves. No LLM, no
Snowflake — pure file + state inspection, so results are reproducible and
diffable.

Evidence collected per file:
  * recorded_done    -- fixer/coordinator listed the file as processed
                        (any of the keys ``_collect_done_files`` unions).
  * fixer_annotated  -- a genuine ``# SCOS:`` fix comment that is NOT a
                        fallback (…0099) import annotation. Deterministic
                        proof the LLM actually engaged with the file.
  * fallback_only    -- carries the fallback "not processed by the LLM fixer
                        agent" signature with NO real fixer edit. Deterministic
                        proof the LLM never processed it (mechanical-only).
  * residual_high_risk -- advisory: a high-risk analyzer snippet that still
                        appears verbatim in the migrated file. Surfaced as a
                        ``needs_review`` hint, NOT a status trigger — the
                        snippet match is fuzzy and can't override the hard
                        marker evidence above (e.g. the LLM may remove a call
                        and leave an explanatory comment).

Status precedence:
  not_attempted -> no completion record and the file isn't on disk.
  migrated      -> a genuine fixer marker is present (LLM engaged), or the
                   file is recorded done with no fallback-only signature.
  partial       -> fallback-only signature with real Spark work to do.
  trivial       -> no Spark surface and no findings (nothing to migrate).

The ``disagreements`` list is the headline output: files where the
self-reported state and the on-disk evidence conflict — most importantly
"state says done but the LLM provably never processed it".

Files classified as ``not_attempted`` are treated as a hard gate failure. In a
healthy run, Phase 2's coverage check should already have caught any missing
output file. If one still reaches Phase 2c, the workflow must escalate instead
of silently passing with ``disagreements == 0``.
