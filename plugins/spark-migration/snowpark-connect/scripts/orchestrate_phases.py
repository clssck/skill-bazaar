"""
SNOW-3385158: Deterministic external orchestrator for Phase 2 chunked dispatch.

Manages Phase 2 (Apply Fixes) dispatch by:
  1. Reading migration_state.json to get manifest, migrated_dir, skill_directory
  2. Splitting the manifest into token-balanced chunks sized for a fixer worker
     pool — at least min(max_parallel, n_files) chunks, each within the budget
  3. Writing chunk assignments to migration_state.json under phase2_chunks/chunks
  4. Printing a wave-based dispatch plan so the coordinator runs up to
     max_parallel fixer sub-agents concurrently per wave
  5. Verifying 100% file coverage (every manifest file is present in Output/)

The mechanical transform (imports, session-init, migration header) is NOT done
here. It runs once, deterministically, in Phase 3 (scripts/update_imports.py)
over every manifest file — so there is no separate pre-fixer "fallback"
transform pass to stamp a premature header. Files the LLM fixer skips are still
caught: Phase 2c (verify_migration.py) flags them as partial from evidence, and
Phase 3 applies the mechanical floor. ``fallback_transform.py`` remains as an
optional manual gap-filler but is no longer part of the automatic pipeline.

Parallelism & state safety: fixer workers run concurrently within a wave and
therefore MUST NOT write migration_state.json (they would race on one file).
Each worker returns a CHUNK_RESULT line and the coordinator is the single
writer of state after each wave completes.

Usage:
    python3 orchestrate_phases.py --state /path/to/migration_state.json --phase 2
    python3 orchestrate_phases.py --state /path/to/migration_state.json --phase 2 --budget 80000
    python3 orchestrate_phases.py --state /path/to/migration_state.json --phase 2 --max-parallel 6
    python3 orchestrate_phases.py --state /path/to/migration_state.json --phase 2 --language scala

Returns exit code 0 on success, 1 on configuration errors.
