"""Data-edge resolution coverage gate.

Checks that the LLM agent analyzed every data-relevant file in the workload.
The agent must report, inside ``llm_resolved_data_edges``:

  ``analyzed_files``
      Workload-relative paths of every file the agent read and found to
      have data I/O.

  ``excluded_files``
      Workload-relative paths of files the agent explicitly checked and
      found to have **no** data I/O (pure utility code, empty files, etc.).

This gate scans *workload_dir* for every ``.py`` / ``.sql`` / ``.ipynb`` file
and verifies that each appears in ``analyzed_files`` **or** ``excluded_files``.
An uncovered file is a gap: the agent may have missed data edges inside it.

Exit codes
----------
0   Full coverage — every file in *workload_dir* is accounted for.
    Prints a JSON summary with counts.
2   Coverage gap — one or more files were neither analyzed nor excluded.
    Prints JSON: ``{"status": "fail", "gap_count": N, "gaps": [paths], ...}``.
    Pass the ``gaps`` list back to the resolver as focused input for another
    round.
3   IO / parse error — do **not** retry; escalate to the user immediately.
    Prints JSON: ``{"status": "error", "message": "..."}``.
