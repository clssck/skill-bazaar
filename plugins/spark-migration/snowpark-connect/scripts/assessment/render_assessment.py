"""End-to-end CLI to render the migration-readiness HTML report.

Builds an :class:`Assessment` IR by merging two complementary sources:

  * ``--analysis-json`` (REQUIRED) — analyzer findings from Phase 1
    (LLM-emitted, run against the post-Phase-0.5 source). Findings are
    *rebased* back to original-source line numbers via ``difflib`` so
    every line number in the rendered report references the UNMODIFIED
    customer source.
  * Original customer source (REQUIRED for accurate per-file metrics) —
    selected automatically based on which of the two flags below is set.

Canonical Phase 1a invocation (used by the migrate skill — see
``migrate-pyspark-to-snowpark-connect/agents/reporter.md`` Section A):

  * ``--migration-state-json <CONVERSION_ROOT>/migration_state.json`` —
    The renderer derives the post-Phase-0.5 source dir
    (``<CONVERSION_ROOT>/Output/``) from the state file's parent,
    materializes the ``phase-0-source`` git tag from the conversion repo
    into a temp directory (the UNMODIFIED customer source the report
    describes), uses both trees to rebase analyzer findings, and reads
    ``recipe_edits`` to populate the standalone auto-resolved panel.

Standalone / legacy invocation (for ad-hoc re-renders outside the
skill, when there is no ``migration_state.json``):

  * ``--workload-dir <path>`` — Treat ``<path>`` as both the source to
    scan AND the snippet source for analyzer findings. No git tag is
    materialized; no rebasing happens; the auto-resolved panel is
    suppressed (no ``recipe_edits`` source available). Use this only
    when re-rendering against a directory the skill never touched.

When neither flag is given the report still renders, but several
prototype sections (file types, library imports, migration waves, the
auto-resolved panel) will be empty.

Phase 1a example::

    python render_assessment.py \\
        --project tiny-workload \\
        --analysis-json        /path/to/Conversion-SCOS-.../analysis.json \\
        --migration-state-json /path/to/Conversion-SCOS-.../migration_state.json \\
        --output-html          /path/to/Conversion-SCOS-.../Reports/MigrationReadinessReport.html \\
        --dump-ir              /path/to/Conversion-SCOS-.../Reports/AssessmentIR.json

Standalone re-render against a raw checkout::

    python render_assessment.py \\
        --project tiny-workload \\
        --analysis-json /path/to/analysis.json \\
        --workload-dir  /path/to/tiny-workload-src \\
        --output-html   /tmp/readiness.html
