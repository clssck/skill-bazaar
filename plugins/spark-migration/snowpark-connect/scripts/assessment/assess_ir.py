"""Intermediate representation (IR) for the migration-readiness HTML report.

The IR is a superset of the fields that prototype
HTML renders across all five tabs (Overview, Detailed Compatibility,
Migration Plan, API Compatibility, Additional Discovery). It is populated
from two complementary sources at Phase 4 of the migrate skill:

  * ``transform_analysis.py``   — risk/finding/compat data from ``analysis.json``
  * ``scan_codebase.py``        — file types, imports, complex patterns, data
                                  sources, dependency graph, migration waves

The two transformers each return a partial Assessment; they are merged via
``Assessment.merge`` before being handed to the adapter. Fields neither source
can populate stay at their defaults (empty list / None), and the adapter
gracefully renders an empty-state placeholder.

       prefer to emit ``src/foo/bar.py``-shaped paths; identical strings
       collapse here.
    2. **Bare-basename → unique long path.** If the analyzer falls back
       to emitting just ``"bar.py"`` (e.g. when its finding's absolute
       path doesn't sit under the chosen workload_root, or its
       sub-transformer never knew the full path), fold those rows into
       the long-path row whose basename uniquely matches. If multiple
       long paths share that basename (e.g. ``__init__.py``), the bare
       row stays orphan rather than over-counting one bucket.
    3. **Empty-path fallback.** Same idea, but for rows that arrived
       with no ``path`` at all.

    Issue counts merge by SUM rather than MAX so that split findings
    (the most common cause of fragmentation in stage 2) actually
    re-aggregate. The codebase scanner always emits ``issues=0`` so
    summing is equivalent to max in the normal one-producer-per-bucket
