"""patch_engine.py — the patch-blueprint substrate for SCOS validation.

Non-Spark I/O is never shimmed or mocked. The validation skill rewrites the
*code under test* with a small, auditable set of search/replace patches: non-Spark
I/O is turned into native Spark reads/writes (via env-var indirection so the same
patched code runs on local PySpark, a
Databricks cluster, or SCOS), secrets/widgets become inline literals, and dead
external calls (logging/telemetry) are deleted outright.

The single source of truth is ``Validation/shared/patch_blueprint.json``. Each
entry is keyed on a single ``relative_file`` and the engine derives both physical
paths from it — ``Validation/source/<relative_file>`` (the Phase A PySpark copy)
and ``Output/<relative_file>`` (the Phase B SCOS copy)::

    {
      "patches": [
        {
          "id": "ingress_users",
          "relative_file": "src/x.py",
          "note": "swap s3 read for native spark read via SCOS_INPUT_* env",
          "search": "<exact text present in BOTH copies>",
          "replace": "df = spark.read.parquet(os.environ['SCOS_INPUT_USERS'])"
        }
      ]
    }

A top-level ``search``/``replace`` is applied to **both** sides. When the source
and migrated copies have drifted (the search text differs), give per-side
overrides; **the presence of a ``source``/``migrated`` sub-block also selects
which sides to patch** (none present ⇒ both)::

    # differ between sides:
    {"id": "x", "relative_file": "src/x.py",
     "source":   {"search": "<text in PySpark copy>",  "replace": "..."},
     "migrated": {"search": "<text in SCOS copy>",     "replace": "..."}}

    # one side only (e.g. a SCOS-only fix); empty block inherits top-level search/replace:
    {"id": "x", "relative_file": "src/x.py", "search": "...", "replace": "...",
     "migrated": {}}

Regex mode (``"regex": true``)::

    {"id": "strip_exit", "relative_file": "**/*.py", "regex": true,
     "replace_all": true,
     "search": "dbutils\\\\.notebook\\\\.exit\\\\([^\\\\n]*\\\\)",
     "replace": "sys.exit(0)"}

When ``regex`` is true, ``search`` is compiled as a Python regex (default flags —
no DOTALL/MULTILINE; opt in via inline ``(?s)``/``(?m)``). ``replace`` supports
backreferences (``\\1``, ``\\g<name>``). The same uniqueness and compile gates
apply.

Glob ``relative_file`` (contains ``*``, ``?``, or ``[``)::

    {"id": "strip_all_exits", "relative_file": "src/**/*.py", "regex": true,
     "replace_all": true, "search": "dbutils\\\\.notebook\\\\.exit\\\\(.*\\\\)",
     "replace": "sys.exit(0)"}

A glob pattern expands to every matching file under each side's prefix directory.
Files with zero matches are silently skipped, but at least one file across all
sides must match the search (otherwise the entry fails). Glob entries use
top-level ``search``/``replace`` only — per-side ``source``/``migrated`` blocks
are not supported (return an error).

Rules enforced by :func:`add_patches` (the gatekeeper):

1. **Uniqueness** — with ``replace_all=false`` (the default) each emitted side's
   ``search`` must match *exactly once* in its file. 0 matches → the search has
   drifted or is wrong; >1 → ambiguous, the author must widen the context. Set
   ``replace_all=true`` to intentionally rewrite every occurrence (e.g. deleting
   every logging call).
2. **Compiles** — after applying in memory, ``.py`` files must still
   ``ast.parse`` cleanly. This is what makes removals (``replace: ""``) safe.
   For ``.ipynb`` notebooks, matching is done per code cell (a single ``search``
   cannot span a cell boundary) with uniqueness enforced across the whole
   notebook; the patched notebook is re-serialized to JSON and translated to
   Python (via ``notebook_source``) before ``ast.parse``.

Patches are applied as an **atomic batch**: entries are validated in order
against an in-memory working copy (so two entries editing the same file stack
correctly), and only if *every* entry passes are the files written, the entries
appended to the blueprint, and **both** the ``Output/`` and ``Validation/source/``
sides committed by ``validate.py`` in one ``[TEST-PATCH]`` commit (so a later
``git revert`` of that commit cleanly undoes both sides). If any entry fails,
nothing is written.

# --- ipywidgets_env_indirection ----------------------------------------------
# ipywidgets differ from dbutils.widgets in two ways that matter here:
#   1. The value is read via attribute access on the widget object
#      (``w.value``), not a standalone ``.get("name")`` call.
#   2. The library is not guaranteed to be installed in the SCOS / local PySpark
#      harness venv.
# So the read side cannot compose with widget_get the way the dbutils
# declaration does. Instead this detector rewrites BOTH sites so no ipywidgets
# object is needed at runtime:
#   * the constructor call  →  os.environ.get("KEY", "<default>")  (a plain str)
#   * every ``<var>.value`` read of that widget  →  ``<var>``      (already a str)
# For the inline form ``widgets.Text(value=…, description=…).value`` there is no
# intermediate variable, so the whole ``…).value`` expression collapses to the
# env lookup in one shot.
#
# The bare ``import ipywidgets`` line is intentionally left in place: removing it
# deterministically is unsafe when non-literal widget calls (which this detector
# skips) still reference the module. If the package is absent from the venv, that
# is handled during venv seeding / by the LLM for any residual references.
#
# Only string-literal ``value=`` args fire (the dominant parameter case). Numeric
# / boolean widgets (IntText, Checkbox, sliders) and dynamic values are skipped.
