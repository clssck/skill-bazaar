# Data Synthesizer

Loaded by `agents/batch-runner.md`. The worktree's `Validation/shared/schemas`
is already mined and pruned to this batch's entrypoints. This agent runs
headless: it completes the remaining schema work, generates mocks, verifies
them, resolves or dismisses warnings, and returns only after the final
`datagen.py --verify` exits `0`, reports `"ok": true`, and leaves no
unresolved warnings.

Before Step 1, read
`$PRIMARY_CONV_ROOT/Validation/shared/batch-learnings.md` into your context and
apply any relevant patterns. Do not mine again, do not re-select entrypoints,
and never prompt the user.

## Exit Gate

Do not finish or return to the worker until the last
`$RUN/datagen.py $SCHEMAS_DIR $MOCK_DATA_DIR --verify` exits `0`, prints
`"ok": true`, and all warnings from that final state are resolved or
explicitly dismissed. `complete: true` alone is not enough, and `--verify`
never fixes or regenerates anything.

## Inputs

- `CONVERSION_ROOT`
- `SKILL_DIRECTORY`

Derived paths:

- `VALIDATION_ROOT = <CONVERSION_ROOT>/Validation`
- `SOURCE_ROOT = Validation/source`
- `MIGRATED_ROOT = <CONVERSION_ROOT>/Output`
- `SHARED_DIR = Validation/shared`
- `MOCK_DATA_DIR = Validation/shared/mock_data`
- `SCHEMAS_DIR = Validation/shared/schemas`

Runner shorthand:

```bash
RUN="uv run --project $SKILL_DIRECTORY/.. python $SKILL_DIRECTORY/scripts"
```

Use `$RUN/<script>.py` throughout. Never invoke the skill scripts with bare
`python`.

## Preconditions

The orchestrator already prepared the batch:

- `SCHEMAS_DIR` contains `manifest.json`, `entrypoints/<id>/`, and optionally
  `sql_files.json`, scoped to this batch only.
- Each entrypoint may still contain `llm_todo`, `columns: []`, guessed names,
  missing kwargs, or other mined gaps.
- The miner already did the broad discovery; your job is to close the remaining
  gaps, not to re-trace whole pipelines.

## Step 1 — Repair Units

**Hard rule: fix one unit, run datagen, run verify, then and only then move to
the next unit.** Do not read ahead into other tables. Do not plan the whole
batch. Do not batch multiple unrelated fixes before a datagen run. The loop
below is not a suggestion — follow it literally every iteration.

Work strictly from `datagen.py --verify`. Do not build a queue. Do not try to
fix the whole batch at once. Read the current `problems` list, take the first
problem, map it to one repair unit, fix that unit, run datagen, and re-run
verify. Stay on that same unit until its problems disappear. Then restart from
the new first problem.

### Repair unit definition

A repair unit is the smallest schema-edit scope that can make the current first
verify problem disappear. You may edit only one unrelated repair unit between
verify passes. If multiple current problems map to the same unit, fix all of
them before the next verify.

Repair unit types:

1. **Table unit** — one `entrypoints/<id>/tables/<KEY>.json`
2. **Entrypoint-meta unit** — one `entrypoints/<id>/_meta.json`
3. **Join unit** — one join-overlap problem fixed in `entrypoints/<id>/_meta.json`
4. **SQL-row unit** — one `sql_files.json` row plus the entrypoint table files it
   must merge into

Not valid repair units:

- the entire batch
- “all tables with the same shape”
- a one-off Python rewrite script that bulk-edits unrelated files

### Problem-to-unit mapping

Map the first string in `problems` to a repair unit with these rules:

1. `sql_files[...]: ...` → SQL-row unit for that `path`
2. `<ep>.tables.<table>: ...` → table unit
3. `<ep>/<table>: ...` or `<ep>/<table>.<col>: ...` → table unit
4. `<ep>: join overlap empty ...` or `<ep>: cross-named join overlap empty ...`
   → join unit in that entrypoint's `_meta.json`
5. Any other `<ep>: ...` schema / required-field problem → entrypoint-meta unit

After you map the first problem, scan the rest of the current `problems` list
and collect only the other problems that map to that same unit. Do not pull in
problems from any other unit.

### Exact repair loop

Run this literally:

1. Run `$RUN/datagen.py $SCHEMAS_DIR $MOCK_DATA_DIR --verify`.
2. If `problems` is empty, leave the repair loop and run the missing-I/O pass.
3. Otherwise, take the first string in `problems`.
4. Map it to exactly one repair unit using the rules above.
5. Collect every other current problem that maps to that same unit.
6. Read only the schema files and source locations needed for that unit.
7. Edit only that unit.
8. Run `$RUN/datagen.py $SCHEMAS_DIR $MOCK_DATA_DIR`.
9. Re-run `$RUN/datagen.py $SCHEMAS_DIR $MOCK_DATA_DIR --verify`.
10. If any problem for that same unit remains, keep working that unit.
11. If no problem for that unit remains, restart from the new first problem.

Always run datagen after a repair-unit edit. The hash mechanism makes cheap
re-runs safe, even when the edit did not affect generated mocks.
An intermediate bare `datagen.py` run may exit non-zero while other repair
units are still incomplete; that is expected mid-loop. `--verify`'s `"ok": true`
is the only completion gate.

**Counts are not repair units.** If verify shows 60 `llm_todo` problems across
15 tables, you still fix one table, run datagen, re-run verify, and only then
move to the next table. Do not read all 15 source files before the first
datagen run.

### Missing-I/O pass

After the repair loop reaches `problems == []`, do one proactive pass over each
batch entrypoint and any imported helper modules it relies on. The goal is to
catch real inputs or outputs that `schema_mine.py` never declared, because
verify can only complain about tables that already exist in `schemas/`.

For `.ipynb` entrypoints the miner translates `%%sql`/`%sql` cell bodies to
`spark.sql(...)` before mining, so table references inside SQL magic cells are
picked up into lineage automatically. Data-carrying `%fs`/`%sh`/`%%bash` magics
are neutralized with a `# NEEDS-REVIEW` marker — scan those for reads/writes the
miner could not see.

Keep this pass simple:

1. Scan each entrypoint once for obvious unmined I/O.
2. Add any real missing read inputs or write targets to the right repair unit.
3. Run datagen once.
4. Re-run verify.
5. If new `problems` appear, go back to the normal repair loop.
6. If `problems` is still empty, continue to warning handling.

Do not turn this into a second full analysis pass. Only add I/O when the source
clearly depends on it at runtime.
Before adding anything, compare the candidate call against tables already
declared for that entrypoint. Repeated loads of the same input, helper wrappers
around an existing table, or dead side effects do not justify a new table row.
If the code path is only patch plumbing, leave it for the patch-author.

### Source-reading discipline

Read source only when the current repair unit truly needs it:

- For `columns: []` or `llm_todo: open column set`, open the file at
  `defined_at:line` and pull only the columns visible in nearby
  `.select()/.selectExpr()/.withColumn()/.filter()/.groupBy()` calls.
- Do not re-trace transitive joins, renames, or full downstream pipelines.
- Unknown columns can be left off; Phase B's inline schema-repair loop catches
  what runtime proves missing.

**Make the edit as soon as you have enough information.** Do not keep reading
more files looking for certainty — incomplete column sets are fine; Phase B
will surface what is missing at runtime. If you have read the source for a
unit and can see the relevant columns or path, write the edit now.

### Common fixes by unit

**Table units**

- `llm_todo` for runtime-variable sink / runtime table name:
  keep the placeholder key, set `original_path` to the templated source form,
  set `access` to `write` or `readwrite`, then delete the todo.
- `open column set` / `columns: []`:
  add the visible source columns only; do not chase downstream lineage.
- Type upgrades:
  replace guessed `string` with the real type when the source shows it clearly
  (cast, `StructType`, numeric ops, `explode`, `collect_list`, etc.). If a read
  column feeds `explode`/`flatten`, or is built by `collect_list`/`collect_set`
  of a struct, it is usually `array<struct<...>>`, not `string`.
- Name recovery:
  fix `original_path` when the mined name is a placeholder, `%`-format,
  `.format()` expansion, dynamic path, or hardcoded production identifier. For
  `dynamic_read`, keep one entry for shared-schema fan-in (`union`) and split
  by `fanout.value` only when the per-value DataFrames have distinct shapes that
  later get joined.
- Schema-only lookups are not read tables:
  delete entries used only for `.schema`.
- Non-relational file/config tables:
  fill `document_schema`, or delete the entry if it is a false positive.
- Helper-referenced columns:
  if a cleaning/helper function touches several tables and the miner missed some
  referenced columns, add the union of the helper's referenced columns to each
  affected table.
- Write-only schemas:
  fill columns for write tables too, and remove Snowflake-folded duplicates such
  as `ITEM` + `item`.
- Intermediate tables with both read and write entries:
  if the same table appears with `access: "read"` and `access: "write"` (or
  `"readwrite"`) and the column sets differ, align them — the read entry must
  include at least the columns the workload projects from it, and the write
  entry must include at least the columns the workload writes. Merge into a
  single `"readwrite"` entry with the union of columns when the table is both
  produced and consumed within the same entrypoint.
- Invocation facts that belong on the table:
  `reader_options`, `values`, `original_path`, `natural_keys`, source-shape
  connector columns, and any file-format facts belong in the table file.
  `reader_options.sep` belongs here for non-default CSV delimiters, and
  `reader_options.header` must be `false` when the workload reads CSV without a
  header. For connector/JDBC reads, declare the physical source columns, not
  only projected aliases; include columns used in `WHERE`/`JOIN`/`ON`/`GROUP BY`.
  For hardcoded production qualifiers, keep `original_path` accurate so the
  patch-author can rebind it later.

**Entrypoint-meta units**

- `source_runtime` must be `"databricks"` or `"spark"` when you finish.
- `entrypoint_kwargs` goes in `_meta.json`; the harness injects these as
  environment variables for all run modes and as kwargs in `callable` mode.
- Use `entrypoint_kwargs` for namespace tokens and config globals such as
  `DATABASE_NAME`, `SCHEMA_STAGING`, and `output_schema`, and choose values that
  bypass top-of-file early-exit guards.
- If the source imports a missing helper/config module only to obtain runtime
  parameters, treat those names as `entrypoint_kwargs` facts, not as new
  tables.
- `cli_args` belongs in `_meta.json` when a script entrypoint parses args.
- Connector-category reads (`category: "connector"`, `format: "snowflake"`)
  still need relevant namespace facts such as `sfDatabase` / `sfSchema`.

**Join units**

- Fix join-overlap problems only by editing `_meta.json` `joins`.
- Use the exact JSON edge shape that verify suggests.
- Re-run datagen after every join edit; pooled values are regenerated from the
  join graph.
- When verify names multiple tables in one join problem, make sure every
  readable table named in that problem is actually connected in `joins`. Do not
  rely on write-only sinks or unrelated tables to bridge the pool.
- Star-pattern joins (one key shared across many tables) count as one join unit:
  add all required edges for that key in a single `_meta.json` edit, then run
  datagen once. Do not add one edge at a time and re-run datagen after each.
- Do not assume stale mocks just because a join edit did not help on the first
  try. First confirm the edge direction, column names, and participating tables.
  Normal datagen should pick up join edits. Use `--all` only if the join graph
  is now clearly correct and the same join problem still persists.
- `join_key: false` only dismisses warnings. It does not dismiss a real
  join-overlap problem once the column is in a pool.

**SQL-row units**

- Work one `sql_files[path]` row at a time.
- Link that SQL file to the entrypoint that executes it.
- Merge every table the row requires into the entrypoint schemas.
- For SQL reads, `access` must include `read`; write-only is wrong.
- Every merged table needs full columns; `columns: []` is never acceptable.
- Skip CTE names only.
- Clear the row's `llm_todo` when the row is fully merged.
- Always use the real `.sql` template. Never stub SQL to make Phase A pass.

### Missed tables and false positives

The miner misses some I/O shapes. While fixing the current unit, you may add or
delete tables when the source makes it obvious:

- Add missed read inputs such as helper-loaded configs, external files, dynamic
  `spark.sql(f"...")` reads, or imported helper-module inputs the job truly
  needs. Common examples: `boto3`, `requests`, `open()` on mounted paths,
  `smart_open`, `fsspec`, and `dbutils.fs`.
- Use `relational: false` + `document_schema` for config/document blobs and
  relational `columns` for tabular extracts.
- Add missed write targets with `access: "write"`, including connector/JDBC
  writes and `saveAsTable` targets even when there is no captured sink baseline.
- `boto3.put_object`, REST posts, DynamoDB writes, and Kafka writes are usually
  write-only side effects, not read tables. If they do not feed data into the
  computation, leave them for the patch blueprint instead of inventing a read
  source.
- Delete false positives such as enum/pivot-literal artifacts, duplicate rows,
  or fake document entries that are really `json.loads` on a DB column.

## Step 2 — Incremental Datagen

Run normal datagen after every repair-unit edit:

```bash
$RUN/datagen.py $SCHEMAS_DIR $MOCK_DATA_DIR
```

Datagen is hash-driven and incremental. It regenerates only tables whose schema
hash changed or whose mock is missing, and it annotates `mock_file` on the
matching table entries.

Do not wipe `mock_data` just because verify failed. Full regeneration is allowed
only when the current repair unit renamed or removed a table or entrypoint:

```bash
# only after rename/remove
rm -rf $MOCK_DATA_DIR
# or:
$RUN/datagen.py $SCHEMAS_DIR $MOCK_DATA_DIR --all
```

## Step 3 — Verify And Review

### 3a. Deterministic self-check

Run:

```bash
$RUN/datagen.py $SCHEMAS_DIR $MOCK_DATA_DIR --verify
```

It returns:

```json
{"ok": true/false, "complete": true/false, "problems": [...], "warnings": [...]}
```

`problems` is the only blocking list. `complete` is derived and persisted from
the remaining todos; do not hand-set it. `warnings` are not part of `ok`, but
you still must handle them before finishing.

Verify checks, at minimum:

- unresolved `llm_todo`
- entrypoint schema validity
- `source_runtime`
- `sql_files` merge correctness
- empty required columns
- duplicate Snowflake column names
- missing / stale mock files
- CSV / JSON / parquet content mismatches
- nullability / enum-domain mismatches
- join overlap

If `ok` is false, stay in Step 1. Do not proceed.

### Warning handling

When `problems` is empty, handle `warnings` before the LLM review. Process them
in listed order, using the same one-unit-at-a-time discipline:

1. Take the first warning.
2. Collect every current warning that can be resolved by the same edit.
3. If they require `joins` or shared `values`, resolve them in one edit, then
   run datagen and verify again.
4. If they are pure `join_key: false` dismissals, batch those dismissals in the
   affected table files, then re-run verify only. Do not re-run datagen for
   pure dismissals.

Use "resolve" for real `joins` / `values` fixes and "dismiss" only for
confirmed non-join-key warnings. Large star-pattern join warnings for one
entrypoint belong in one `_meta.json` edit, not one edge at a time.

Do not enter Step 3b while warnings remain unresolved or undismissed.

### 3b. LLM review with `--peek`

After `problems` is empty and warnings are handled, inspect the generated mocks:

```bash
$RUN/datagen.py $MOCK_DATA_DIR/<ep_id>/<mock_file> --peek
```

Check:

- declared types match the workload's real expectations
- enum/categorical columns contain realistic allowed values
- literal filter domains are represented in mocks when the source uses small
  fixed sets such as `isin(...)`, `IN (...)`, or exact code comparisons
- join keys that must match really overlap
- sample values are plausible for the domain
- nullable columns still contain nulls and NOT NULL keys do not

Prefer systematic schema fixes plus another datagen run over hand-editing mock
files. Hand-edited mocks are allowed only for one-off value tweaks and will be
overwritten by a later datagen regenerate.

## Step 4 — Record Milestone

Only after the last verify returned `"ok": true` and no unresolved warnings
remain:

```bash
$RUN/validate.py \
  record-milestone --conv-root $CONVERSION_ROOT --milestone synth_deep
```

If you edited mocks in Step 3b, run one final verify before recording the
milestone.

## Step 5 — Delete `sql_files.json`

Delete `sql_files.json` only after all data generation, all SQL merges, the
final verify, and the milestone record are complete:

```bash
rm -f $SCHEMAS_DIR/sql_files.json
```

Do not delete it earlier; `--verify` checks the merged entrypoint schemas
against it while it exists.

## Schema Contract

Entrypoint JSON must validate against
`validate-pyspark-to-snowpark-connect/schemas/entrypoint.schema.json`.
Verify runs that schema first, so fix schema-path errors before debugging
mock-file or SQL-catalog details.

Key fields:

- `run_mode`: `"script"` or `"callable"`
- `source_runtime`: `"databricks"` or `"spark"`
- `tables`: dict keyed by name; each entry has `access`, `columns`, and optional
  `category`
- `mock_file`: filename relative to `mock_data/<ep_id>/`
- non-relational tables: `relational: false`, `format`, `document_schema`

## Self-check

Before finishing, confirm:

1. The last `datagen.py --verify` returned `"ok": true` and exit code `0`.
2. No warnings from the final verify remain unresolved or undismissed.
3. `complete: true` is present because verify derived it, not because you set it.
4. Every batch entrypoint has `run_mode`, `import_roots`, and `entrypoint_kwargs`.
5. Every readable file table has a `mock_file` that exists on disk.
6. Every SQL read table is declared with `access` including `read` and full columns.
7. No `llm_todo` remains on batch entrypoints or SQL catalog rows.
8. Every batch entrypoint has `source_runtime` set to `"databricks"` or `"spark"`.
