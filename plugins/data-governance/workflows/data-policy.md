If either is missing, do **NOT** load the category-seeded workflow — fall through to the normal routing (a plain "create a policy" request without the sentinel is handled by the conversational or 2-stage create flows). When it matches, follow the category-seeded workflow exclusively; do not fall through to the generic create flow below even though this message also contains `Create` and `policy`. The workflow itself asks which policy type to create (masking or projection).

## When to Use/Load
Use this skill when a user asks to create, modify, audit, or troubleshoot Snowflake data policies, or needs help choosing the right policy approach.

**Also use when:**
- Protecting a specific column (SSN, email, phone, TIMESTAMP, or any data type) with masking
- Checking existing policies before adding a new one ("same access rules", "existing masking")
- Controlling which roles can see column values
- Any request containing "protect sensitive data", "mask column", "column masking", "role-based access"

## Content Layers

Load **only** the file(s) matching the detected intent — do not load all layers upfront:

| Intent | Triggers | Load |
|--------|----------|------|
| PATTERNS | "example", "ABAC", "template", "show me how", "pattern" | `data-policy/L2_proven_patterns.md` |
| BEST_PRACTICES | "best practice", "should I", "anti-pattern", "governance", "memoizable" | `data-policy/L3_best_practices.md` |
| CREATE | "create policy", "new policy", "mask column", "restrict access", "extend policy", "protect", "same rules" | `data-policy/L4_workflow_create.md` |
| **CREATE (category-seeded UI flow)** | **First user message STARTS WITH `/data-governance Create a data policy for categories` AND contains the sentinel `[source=classification-wizard]`** (e.g. `/data-governance Create a data policy for categories AGE, CITY, COUNTRY [source=classification-wizard]`) | **`data-policy/L4_workflow_create_from_categories.md`** — and ONLY this file. Checked BEFORE the generic UI 2-stage create row below. Both the prefix and the sentinel are required; the workflow asks which policy type to create (masking or projection). See "UI Trigger Detection" below. |
| **CREATE (UI 2-stage flow)** | **First user message starts with `/data-governance Create a new <policy type> policy for me`** (any of: masking, row access, projection, aggregation, join, tokenization) | **`data-policy/L4_workflow_create_2stage_ui.md`** — and ONLY this file. See "UI Trigger Detection" below. |
| **EDIT (UI 2-stage flow)** | **First user message starts with `/data-governance Edit the <POLICY_KIND> POLICY named <POLICY_NAME> located at <DB>.<SCHEMA>.`** | **`data-policy/L4_workflow_edit_2stage_ui.md`** — and ONLY this file. See "UI Trigger Detection" below. |
| AUDIT | "audit policies", "review policies", "inventory", "health check", "scattered policies", "consolidate", "migrate" | `data-policy/L4_workflow_audit.md` |
| COMPLIANCE | "regulation", "HIPAA", "GDPR", "PCI", "CCPA", "SOX", "FERPA", "compliance", "healthcare", "financial", "privacy law" | `../reference/data-policy/compliance_reference.md` |
| SYNTAX / CONCEPTS | "how does X work", "what does X do", "what's the difference between X and Y", standalone keyword question (e.g., `ENTITY KEY`, `ALLOWED JOIN KEYS`, `USING (...)`, `JOIN_REQUIRED`) — no create/edit/audit verb | Answer concisely from the policy model and ground via Snowflake docs lookup (use `snowflake_product_docs` when available; else `cortex search docs "<query>"` via bash). Cite the relevant `docs.snowflake.com` URL so the user can drill deeper. Do **not** restate raw policy syntax inline in this skill — Snowflake docs are the source of truth and stay current automatically. If the question pivots to a create/edit/audit verb, route to the matching workflow row. |

If intent spans multiple layers (e.g., "create a best-practice masking policy"), load the best-practices reference plus the conversational create workflow. If intent is unclear, ask clarifying questions.

## UI Trigger Detection (check BEFORE Step 0)

Before doing anything else — even Step 0 session-context check — examine the **first** user message in this conversation. If it matches one of the slash-command patterns below, hand control entirely to the matching workflow and follow it instead of the rest of this file.

**Category-seeded create pattern (check FIRST — highest precedence, case-insensitive):**
```
/data-governance Create a data policy for categories <CAT1>, <CAT2>, ... [source=classification-wizard]
```
where the list after `for categories` is one or more detected classification categories and `[source=classification-wizard]` is a fixed sentinel the wizard appends. The command is policy-type-agnostic on purpose — the workflow asks the user which data policy type to create (masking or projection today; aggregation, row access, and tokenization may be added later).

What "match" means (BOTH required): the first turn **starts with** the exact prefix `/data-governance Create a data policy for categories` **and** contains the sentinel token `[source=classification-wizard]`. The sentinel is emitted only by the Snowsight classification wizard's "Create with CoCo" button and is what prevents accidental triggering from conversational phrasing.

**If matched** → load the **category-seeded data-policy create workflow** (load target in the Content Layers table above) and follow it strictly. Do **NOT** fall through to the generic create pattern below, even though the message also contains `Create` and `policy`. Do not run the universal intake (Step 1). Do not load the conversational or UI 2-stage create workflows.

**If the prefix matches but the sentinel is absent** → do **NOT** load the category-seeded workflow. Treat it as an ordinary create request and route via the normal create flow (a real user typing something similar without the sentinel should get the standard experience).

> **Hard-guarantee note (UI/agent-config layer).** Skill files are prompt-routed, not access-controlled, so this detection is a *practical* guard, not an enforced boundary — a determined user could still type the full command including the sentinel. The actual guarantee that this flow is reachable only from "Create with CoCo" must be enforced where the command originates: the classification wizard is the only surface that emits this command (with the sentinel), into the scoped CoCo window it opens. Keep the sentinel string in sync with what the wizard emits.

**Create pattern (case-insensitive, allow trailing punctuation):**
```
/data-governance Create a new <policy type> policy for me
```
where `<policy type>` is one of `masking`, `row access`, `projection`, `aggregation`, `join`, `tokenization` (the word `policy` may be omitted in the type, e.g., "Create a new join policy").

What "match" means: the first turn starts with `/data-governance`, contains the verb `Create` and the noun `policy`, and identifies one of the six supported types.

**If matched** → load the **UI 2-stage create workflow** (load target in the Content Layers table above) and follow it strictly. Do not run the universal intake (Step 1). Do not load the conversational create workflow. Do not auto-apply best-practice suggestions mid-conversation.

**Edit pattern (case-insensitive, allow trailing punctuation):**
```
/data-governance Edit the <POLICY_KIND> POLICY named <POLICY_NAME> located at <DB>.<SCHEMA>.
```
where `<POLICY_KIND>` is one of `MASKING`, `ROW ACCESS`, `PROJECTION`, `AGGREGATION`, `JOIN`, `TOKENIZATION` (case-insensitive).

What "match" means: the first turn starts with `/data-governance`, contains the verb `Edit` and the noun `POLICY`, and pre-supplies a policy name and a `<DB>.<SCHEMA>` location.

**If matched** → load the **UI 2-stage edit workflow** (load target in the Content Layers table above) and follow it strictly. Do not load the conversational create workflow. The first content question must be *definition or attachment?* (the policy name is already known from the slash command — do not ask for it).

**If neither pattern matches** → continue with Step 0 below as usual. The conversational create workflow is the right choice for any phrasing that doesn't use a slash command.

> The UI workflows exist because the data-governance UI component sends these exact slash commands and expects specific 2-stage conversation shapes. For any other surface (CLI, ad-hoc questions), the standard workflow is the right answer.

## Pre-Write Approval Rule

**Before executing ANY state-changing SQL** (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `APPLY`):

1. Summarize in plain language what will be created, modified, or dropped.
2. Show the exact SQL that will be executed.
3. Wait for explicit user approval before executing.

**Read-only queries** (`SELECT`, `SHOW`, `DESCRIBE`, `GET_DDL`) may be executed immediately without confirmation.

## Workflow

> ⚠️ **First, check the UI Trigger Detection section above.** If the user's first message matches the `/data-governance Create a new <policy type> policy for me` slash command, jump to the **UI 2-stage create workflow** (load target in the Content Layers table) immediately and ignore the steps below.

### Step 0: Verify Session Context (once per session)

Run this **once at the start of the first query**. If you have already confirmed warehouse, database, and schema are set earlier in this conversation, skip this step.

```sql
SELECT
    CURRENT_USER()      AS current_user,
    CURRENT_ROLE()      AS current_role,
    CURRENT_DATABASE()  AS current_database,
    CURRENT_SCHEMA()    AS current_schema,
    CURRENT_WAREHOUSE() AS current_warehouse;
```

Fix any NULL or mismatched values before continuing. **Stop if warehouse is NULL** — policy `CREATE` and `APPLY` statements require an active warehouse.

### Step 1: Universal Intake (CREATE workflows)

When the user wants to create or extend a policy, ask these questions **before** loading the create workflow. Skip any question the user has already answered.

1. **What data are you protecting?** — Specific tables/columns, or should Cortex discover sensitive columns automatically?
2. **What kind of protection do you need?** — Hide/transform column values at read time (**masking**); filter rows by user (**row access**); block column projection entirely (**projection**); enforce minimum aggregation (**aggregation**); require queries to join the table to another (**join**, typical for clean rooms); replace values at write time so the original is never stored (**tokenization**)?
3. **Who should have access?** — Which roles or users should see the real data? Should the check respect role hierarchy (`IS_ROLE_IN_SESSION`) or match only the active role?
4. **Are there existing policies on similar data?** — If yes, Cortex will examine them first and reuse or extend where possible.

After these answers, load the **conversational create workflow** (load target in the Content Layers table) and follow its question-first workflow, which first resolves auto-discover versus explicit target scope and then asks policy-type-specific follow-ups.

### Step 2: Route Non-CREATE Intents

For AUDIT, PATTERNS, BEST_PRACTICES, or COMPLIANCE intents, load the relevant file from the Content Layers table and follow its workflow directly. For raw Snowflake policy syntax questions ("how do I write a `CREATE MASKING POLICY` statement?", "what's the SQL for `ALLOWED JOIN KEYS`?", etc.), defer to the official Snowflake docs (e.g., via `cortex search docs` or the agent's web search) rather than restating syntax in the skill — Snowflake docs are the source of truth for syntax and stay current automatically.

### Step 3: Post-Creation Follow-Up (CREATE workflows only)

After a masking or row access policy is applied, briefly check whether auto-classification is enabled:

```sql
SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'CLASSIFICATION_PROFILE' IN DATABASE <database>;
```

If not enabled, mention it as an optional follow-up: "Auto-classification can automatically detect and tag new sensitive columns. Would you like to set that up?" If the user says yes, load the **sensitive-data classification workflow** (sibling workflow in this skill — see Content Layers / `workflows/` directory).

## Stopping Points
- ✋ After Step 1 intake questions answered (confirm understanding before proceeding)
- ✋ Before any `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, or `APPLY` statement (pre-write approval rule)
- ✋ After audit scope confirmed (audit workflow)
- ✋ After health report presented (audit workflow)

## Output
- Clear policy recommendation or draft SQL aligned to the chosen track
- Health report with recommendations (for audit workflow)
