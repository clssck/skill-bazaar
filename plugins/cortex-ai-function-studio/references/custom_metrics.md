# Custom Evaluation Metrics

Create domain-specific evaluation metrics tailored to your AI function's requirements.

## When to Load

Load from evaluate or optimize skill when user says: "custom metric", "create metric", "define metric", "my own metric", "custom evaluation", "domain-specific metric", "new metric".

## Information Model

| Field | Required | Default | Confirm | Dependencies |
|-------|----------|---------|---------|--------------|
| `metric_name` | Yes | - | No | - |
| `metric_description` | Yes | - | No | - |
| `metric_code` | Yes | (generated) | **Yes** | metric_description |
| `database` | Yes | (from context) | No | - |
| `schema` | Yes | (from context) | No | - |

**Critical fields** (always confirm even if pre-provided): `metric_code`

**Simple fields** (accept silently if pre-provided): `metric_name`, `metric_description`, `database`, `schema`

## Pre-Collection

Before prompting, scan the user's initial message and any prior context for already-provided information:

1. **Metric name**: Look for snake_case names like "keyword_coverage", "json_validator"
2. **Metric description**: Look for descriptions of what to measure ("check if keywords appear", "validate JSON format")
3. **database/schema**: Usually inherited from parent workflow context

For each piece found:
- **Simple fields**: Accept silently, proceed without re-asking
- **Critical fields**: Present for confirmation even if pre-provided ("Here's the metric code I generated — confirm?")

## How Custom Metrics Work

A custom metric is a Python UDF created directly in Snowflake. The UDF accepts two VARCHAR inputs (expected and predicted) and returns a VARIANT containing a numeric `score` and text `feedback`. The evaluation and optimization SPROCs call this UDF by its fully qualified name.

Evaluation metrics produce a numeric score **and** text feedback explaining why a prediction is correct or incorrect. This feedback is critical: during the optimization step, it's fed back to the LLM to help refine the prompt your function uses. Good feedback is specific and actionable -- e.g., "Found 3 of 5 keywords; missing: X, Y" is far more useful than "Partially correct".

### Restriction: Deterministic and Composite Only

Custom metrics must be **deterministic**. They must NOT:
- Call `AI_COMPLETE` or any other LLM
- Call `get_active_session()` or use a Snowpark session
- Implement any form of LLM-as-judge logic
- Attempt to replicate `llm_judge` behavior in any way

If the user asks for an LLM-based custom metric, explain:
```
Custom metrics must be deterministic -- they cannot call LLMs or use AI_COMPLETE.

For LLM-based evaluation, use the built-in 'llm_judge' metric directly, instead of a custom metric:
  METRIC_NAME = 'llm_judge'

If you need LLM judgment combined with deterministic checks, run two
separate evaluations: one with 'llm_judge' and one with your custom metric.
```

Do NOT attempt to work around this restriction. Do NOT offer to embed LLM calls in UDF code. The built-in `llm_judge` is the only supported path for LLM-based evaluation.

### Metric Types

Custom metrics come in two flavors:

1. **Simple** — A single check applied to the entire expected/predicted strings
2. **Composite** — Multiple checks applied to individual fields of structured (JSON) expected/predicted values, combined with configurable weights

Both types use the same UDF contract. The difference is in the internal logic.

### The UDF Contract

Every custom metric UDF must follow this contract:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION {database}.{schema}.{metric_name}(
    EXPECTED VARCHAR,
    PREDICTED VARCHAR
)
RETURNS VARIANT
LANGUAGE PYTHON
RUNTIME_VERSION = '3.12'
PACKAGES = ('snowflake-snowpark-python')
HANDLER = 'evaluate'
AS $$
def evaluate(expected, predicted):
    # Your scoring logic here
    score = ...   # float between 0.0 and 1.0
    feedback = ... # string explaining the score
    return {"score": score, "feedback": feedback}
$$;
```

The UDF returns a VARIANT dict with `score` and `feedback` keys.

**Note on input types:** The EXPECTED and PREDICTED parameters are always VARCHAR. When the original data is VARIANT (e.g., multi-key function output or VARIANT label column from synthetic data), values arrive as JSON strings (e.g., `'{"category": "billing"}'`). For simple metrics comparing single scalar values, this is transparent. For structured/multi-key outputs, **always use `_parse_json()`** (see below) to handle both plain strings and JSON objects.

### Robust JSON Parsing (MANDATORY)

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: When parsing JSON in custom metrics, **never use `json.loads()` directly**. Snowflake VARIANT columns cast to VARCHAR often produce Python-style single-quoted strings (e.g., `{'category': 'billing'}`) instead of valid JSON double-quoted strings. Raw `json.loads()` will fail silently on these, scoring every row as 0.0.

**Every custom metric that parses JSON must include and use this `_parse_json` helper:**

```python
import ast
import json

def _parse_json(text):
    """Parse JSON that may use single quotes (common from Snowflake VARIANT).
    
    Snowflake VARIANT-to-VARCHAR casts often produce Python-style dicts with
    single quotes instead of standard JSON double quotes. This helper handles
    both formats gracefully.
    """
    try:
        return json.loads(text)
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, TypeError):
        pass
    try:
        return ast.literal_eval(text)
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
        pass
    return None
```

**Usage pattern** — always check for `None` after parsing:

```python
exp = _parse_json(expected)
pred = _parse_json(predicted)
if exp is None or pred is None:
    return {"score": 0.0, "feedback": "Could not parse expected/predicted as JSON"}
```

This helper is required in all composite metrics and any simple metric that parses structured data. Do NOT skip it or replace it with raw `json.loads()`.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Understand What the User Wants to Measure

**If `metric_name` and `metric_description` already collected** (user provided upfront):
- Skip the prompt — proceed directly to Step 2
- Acknowledge: "I'll create the `{metric_name}` metric for {metric_description}"

**If not collected**, have a conversation to understand the metric. Ask:

```
What would you like to measure? Describe what makes a prediction correct,
partially correct, or incorrect for your use case.
```

Then determine the metric type:

```
Is this a:
1. Simple metric - One check on the full expected/predicted text
2. Composite metric - Different checks on different fields of structured JSON output
```

**For simple metrics**, gather:
- What it measures and how scoring works
- What feedback should look like

Then suggest a snake_case name and confirm with the user:

```
Based on your description, I'd suggest naming this metric: {suggested_name}

Would you like to use this name, or choose your own?
(Names must be snake_case, e.g., keyword_coverage, format_check, field_completeness)
```

If the user provides their own name, enforce snake_case: lowercase, underscores only, no spaces or special characters. If their name doesn't comply, convert it and confirm:
```
I've converted that to snake_case: {converted_name}
Does that work?
```

Then proceed to Step 2.

**For composite metrics**, run the field configuration workflow:

**Step 1a: Identify fields from context**

You should already know the AI function's output fields from the evaluate/optimize workflow context (the function's response schema). List them:

```
Your function produces these output fields:
- category (string)
- summary (string)  
- entities (array)

I'll configure a check for each field. Some common check types:

| Check Type | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| exact_match | Score 1.0 if values match exactly (case-insensitive) |
| fuzzy_match | Score based on string similarity (uses SequenceMatcher) |
| contains_match | Score 1.0 if expected value appears within predicted |
| keyword_overlap | Score based on fraction of expected keywords found in predicted |
| skip | Exclude this field from scoring |

You can describe custom logic for every field -- just tell me what you want
and I'll write the check for it.
```

**Step 1b: Configure each field**

Go field by field. For each field, ask:

```
Field: {field_name} ({field_type})
How should this field be scored?
- Pick a common check type (exact_match / fuzzy_match / contains_match / keyword_overlap / skip)
- Or describe what you want (e.g., "score based on number of matching list items",
  "1.0 if the value is a valid date, 0.0 otherwise", "check that it starts with a specific prefix")
Weight? (0.0 - 1.0, will be normalized)
```

If the user picks a common check type, use the corresponding code pattern from the check type implementations below. If they describe custom logic, write a deterministic implementation that matches their description. All custom logic must be deterministic -- no LLM calls.

Build a configuration table as you go:

```
Field configuration:

| Field | Check | Weight |
|-------|-------|--------|
| category | exact_match | 0.3 |
| summary | fuzzy_match | 0.5 |
| entities | items in expected list found in predicted | 0.2 |

Does this look right?
```

After the field configuration is approved, suggest a snake_case name and confirm:

```
Based on your field configuration, I'd suggest naming this metric: {suggested_name}

Would you like to use this name, or choose your own?
(Names must be snake_case, e.g., article_quality, output_accuracy, multi_field_check)
```

If the user provides their own name, enforce snake_case: lowercase, underscores only, no spaces or special characters. If their name doesn't comply, convert it and confirm:
```
I've converted that to snake_case: {converted_name}
Does that work?
```

**⚠️ STOP**: Get user approval on the field configuration and metric name before proceeding to Step 2.

Collect the final configuration as a structured spec:
- `metric_name`: snake_case name
- `fields`: list of `{name, check_type, weight}`

This spec drives code generation in Step 2.

### Step 2: Write the Metric

Write the Python logic that will go inside the UDF. The code must be **deterministic** — no LLM calls, no session usage, no AI_Complete. If the user asks for LLM-based checks, redirect them to the built-in `llm_judge` metric.

All metrics must:
1. Have a handler function named `evaluate`
2. Accept `(expected: str, predicted: str)` parameters
3. Return a dict with `score` (float 0.0-1.0) and `feedback` (string)
4. Feedback explains the score in a way that helps optimization
5. **Use `_parse_json()` instead of `json.loads()` for any JSON parsing** (see Robust JSON Parsing section above)

Write the file to `/tmp/{metric_name}.py` for local testing first.

#### Simple Metrics

For simple metrics, write the logic directly. Available standard library modules: `json`, `ast`, `re`, `difflib`, `math`, `collections`, `string`.

**Example -- keyword coverage metric:**

```python
def evaluate(expected, predicted):
    """Measures what fraction of expected keywords appear in the prediction."""
    expected_lower = expected.lower()
    predicted_lower = predicted.lower()

    expected_words = {w for w in expected_lower.split() if len(w) >= 3}
    predicted_words = set(predicted_lower.split())

    if not expected_words:
        return {"score": 1.0, "feedback": "No keywords to match"}

    matched = expected_words & predicted_words
    score = len(matched) / len(expected_words)

    if score == 1.0:
        return {"score": 1.0, "feedback": f"All {len(expected_words)} keywords found"}

    missing = expected_words - matched
    return {
        "score": score,
        "feedback": f"Found {len(matched)}/{len(expected_words)} keywords. Missing: {', '.join(sorted(missing))}",
    }
```

#### Composite Metrics

For composite metrics, use the field configuration from Step 1b to generate the code. The generated code must follow this structure:

1. Parse expected/predicted as JSON
2. For each configured field, apply the specified check
3. Collect `(field:check_description, score, weight)` tuples
4. Combine with weighted average
5. Build feedback with per-field detail and weight breakdown

**Standard check types** — use these when generating field blocks:

| Check Type | Logic | Score |
|------------|-------|-------|
| `exact_match` | Case-insensitive string equality | 0.0 or 1.0 |
| `fuzzy_match` | `SequenceMatcher(None, exp.lower(), pred.lower()).ratio()` | 0.0–1.0 continuous |
| `contains_match` | `exp.lower() in pred.lower()` | 0.0 or 1.0 |
| `keyword_overlap` | Fraction of expected words (len≥3) found in predicted | 0.0–1.0 continuous |
| `array_contains` | Fraction of expected list items found in `json.dumps(pred).lower()` | 0.0–1.0 continuous |

Each field block should: extract values via `exp.get("{field}", "")` / `pred.get("{field}", "")`, compute a score, and append `(name, score, weight)` to `sub_scores` and a description to `feedback_parts`.

**Custom per-field logic:** If the user describes custom logic instead of a standard check, write a deterministic implementation. Same pattern: extract, score 0.0–1.0, append to `sub_scores` and `feedback_parts`. No LLM calls.

**Composite code template** — assemble the field blocks into this structure:

```python
import ast
import json
from difflib import SequenceMatcher

# Include the _parse_json helper from the "Robust JSON Parsing" section above

def evaluate(expected, predicted):
    """Composite metric: {one-line description from field config}."""
    exp = _parse_json(expected)
    pred = _parse_json(predicted)
    if exp is None or pred is None:
        return {"score": 0.0, "feedback": "Could not parse expected/predicted as JSON"}

    sub_scores = []
    feedback_parts = []

    # --- {field_1}: {check_type_1} (weight: {weight_1}) ---
    {field_1_block}

    # --- {field_2}: {check_type_2} (weight: {weight_2}) ---
    {field_2_block}

    # ... one block per configured field ...

    # --- Combine weighted scores ---
    total_weight = sum(w for _, _, w in sub_scores)
    combined_score = sum(s * w for _, s, w in sub_scores) / total_weight if total_weight > 0 else 0.0

    detail = " | ".join(feedback_parts)
    breakdown = ", ".join(f"{name}={s:.2f}*{w}" for name, s, w in sub_scores)
    feedback = f"{detail} [weights: {breakdown}]"

    return {"score": combined_score, "feedback": feedback}
```

Do NOT deviate from this structure for composite metrics. Each field gets one block that computes a score and appends feedback. All field logic must be deterministic.

**⚠️ STOP**: Show the generated code to the user for review and approval before proceeding.

### Step 3: Generate Test Cases for Preview

Before creating the UDF, generate 3-5 representative test cases for the user to review. These should cover:
- A perfect match (expected score ~1.0)
- A complete mismatch (expected score ~0.0 for exact-match metrics; for fuzzy_match fields, SequenceMatcher gives non-zero similarity even for unrelated strings, so compute the actual expected score rather than assuming 0.0)
- One or two partial matches (expected score between 0.0 and 1.0)
- An edge case relevant to the use case

Present them in a table:

Example (keyword coverage metric):
```
I've generated some test cases for your metric. Please review:

| # | Expected | Predicted | Target Score | Description |
|---|----------|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| 1 | "the cat sat on the mat" | "the cat sat on the mat" | ~1.0 | Perfect match |
| 2 | "the cat sat on the mat" | "a dog ran in the park" | ~0.0 | No overlap |
| 3 | "the cat sat on the mat" | "the cat on mat" | ~0.5 | Partial match |
| 4 | "" | "some text" | ~1.0 | Empty expected (edge case) |

Do these test cases look right? Feel free to modify any or add your own.
```

**⚠️ STOP**: Get user approval on the test cases before running them.

### Step 4: Test with Preview

The local preview test catches metric bugs (wrong scoring, broken JSON parsing) before the UDF is deployed. Do not skip it, even if the user says "go ahead".

Write a test script at `/tmp/test_{metric_name}.py` that:
1. Imports `evaluate` from `/tmp/{metric_name}.py`
2. Runs each approved test case, comparing actual score to target (tolerance ±0.05)
3. Prints PASS/FAIL per case with score, target, and feedback

Run it:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=<SKILL_DIRECTORY>/scripts uv run --project <SKILL_DIRECTORY> python /tmp/test_{metric_name}.py
```

Present results as a table with columns: `#`, `Description`, `Score`, `Target`, `Status`, `Feedback`.

**⚠️ STOP**: All tests must pass and user must approve the results before creating the UDF. If tests fail or feedback doesn't look right, fix the metric and re-test.

### Step 5: Create the UDF

Generate and execute the UDF DDL:

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION {database}.{schema}.{metric_name}(
    EXPECTED VARCHAR,
    PREDICTED VARCHAR
)
RETURNS VARIANT
LANGUAGE PYTHON
RUNTIME_VERSION = '3.12'
PACKAGES = ('snowflake-snowpark-python')
HANDLER = 'evaluate'
AS $$
{metric_code}
$$;
```

Where `{metric_code}` is the Python code from Step 2 (the `evaluate` function and any imports).

**⚠️ STOP**: Show the full DDL to the user for review. Once approved, execute it via the SQL tool — the metric does not exist until the `CREATE FUNCTION` statement actually runs against Snowflake. Displaying the DDL is not enough.

Verify the UDF was created:
```sql
DESCRIBE FUNCTION {database}.{schema}.{metric_name}(VARCHAR, VARCHAR);
```

Quick smoke test in SQL:
```sql
SELECT {database}.{schema}.{metric_name}('expected text', 'predicted text') AS result;
```

### Step 6: Clean Up Local Temp Files

After the UDF is successfully created and verified in Snowflake, remove the temporary files that were created on the user's behalf during development. Only remove files that this workflow created — do not delete any other files in `/tmp/`.

Delete these two files:
- `/tmp/{metric_name}.py` — the metric code written in Step 2
- `/tmp/test_{metric_name}.py` — the test script written in Step 4

```bash
rm /tmp/{metric_name}.py /tmp/test_{metric_name}.py
```

Confirm to the user:
```
Cleaned up temporary files:
- /tmp/{metric_name}.py
- /tmp/test_{metric_name}.py

The metric logic now lives in Snowflake as a UDF — these local files are no longer needed.
```

If either file doesn't exist (e.g., already removed), that's fine — skip it silently.

### Step 7: Use It

The metric is now available by its fully qualified UDF name. To use it in evaluation or optimization:

- Pass `'{metric_name}'` as the `METRIC_NAME` parameter
- Pass `'{database}.{schema}.{metric_name}'` as the `CUSTOM_METRIC_UDF` parameter

See `evaluate/SKILL.md` Step 4 or `optimize/SKILL.md` Step 5 for full SPROC call syntax.

```
Custom metric "{metric_name}" is ready!

UDF: {database}.{schema}.{metric_name}

What would you like to do next?
1. **Evaluate** - Test your AI function with this metric
2. **Optimize** - Optimize your AI function with this metric
3. **Create Another** - Define another custom metric
4. **Done** - Exit
```

If Evaluate -> Load `evaluate/SKILL.md` with metric pre-selected.
If Optimize -> Load `optimize/SKILL.md` with metric pre-selected.

## Stopping Points

- Step 2: Review generated code before testing
- Step 3: Review and approve test cases
- Step 4: All tests must pass and results approved (preview test must actually run)
- Step 5: Review DDL before executing, then execute the `CREATE FUNCTION` against Snowflake
- Step 6: Clean up temp files after UDF creation
