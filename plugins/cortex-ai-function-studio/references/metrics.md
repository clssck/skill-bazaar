# Evaluation Metrics

## When to Load

Load from evaluate/optimize workflows when selecting a metric. Triggers: "which metric", "select metric", "evaluation metric", "how to score".

## Architecture

Metrics are implemented as core Python functions with no external dependencies (except stdlib `difflib`).

**Implementation:** See `src/metrics_core.py`

## Available Metrics

| Metric | Use When | Score |
|--------|----------|-------|
| `exact_match` | Classification, categorical outputs, yes/no | 1.0 if exact match, else 0.0 |
| `fuzzy_match` | Minor variations, typos acceptable | 1.0 if similarity >= threshold |
| `contains_match` | Key answer embedded in verbose output | 1.0 if expected in predicted |
| `redaction_match` | PII redaction, placeholder content varies | 1.0 if text matches outside brackets |
| `llm_judge` | Open-ended, paraphrases acceptable | 1.0 if LLM judges correct, else 0.0 |

## Core Function Signatures

All core functions return `tuple[float, str]` = (score, feedback).

```python
def exact_match_core(expected: str, predicted: str, **kwargs) -> tuple[float, str]
def fuzzy_match_core(expected: str, predicted: str, **kwargs) -> tuple[float, str]
def contains_match_core(expected: str, predicted: str, **kwargs) -> tuple[float, str]
def redaction_match_core(expected: str, predicted: str, **kwargs) -> tuple[float, str]
def llm_judge_core(expected: str, predicted: str, **kwargs) -> tuple[float, str]
```

**Options passed via kwargs:**

| Metric | Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| fuzzy_match | threshold | float | 0.85 | Minimum similarity score |
| llm_judge | task_description | str | '' | Task context for the judge |
| llm_judge | llm_call | callable | required | Function to call LLM |

## Usage

### In Evaluate SPROC

The SPROC imports `metrics_core.py` from the stage and uses `compute_metric()`:

```python
from metrics_core import compute_metric

score, feedback = compute_metric(metric_name, expected, predicted, **options)
```

### In Optimize

The optimizer imports `metrics_core.py` and uses the same `compute_metric()` function to score prompt variations:

```python
from metrics_core import compute_metric

score, feedback = compute_metric(metric_name, expected, predicted, **metric_options)
```

## Metric Selection Guide

| Task Type | Recommended Metric |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Classification | exact_match |
| Named Entity Extraction | fuzzy_match |
| Q&A with fixed answers | exact_match, contains_match |
| Open-ended generation | llm_judge |
| Verbose model outputs | contains_match |
| PII redaction | redaction_match |

## Metric Selection Prompt

**Always** present ALL 6 options below. If none of the built-in metrics fit the user's needs, a custom metric is the right answer.

**Dynamic ordering:** Use the Metric Selection Guide above to identify the recommended metric for the user's task type. Place the recommended metric **first** in the list (as option 1) and reorder the remaining built-in metrics after it (options 2-5). Always append "Create custom metric" as the last option. Add a short `(recommended)` tag and a brief reason to the top metric.

Present this menu when asking users to select a metric:

```
Which metric would you like to use?

Built-in metrics:
1. {recommended_metric} (recommended — {brief reason, e.g. "best for PII redaction tasks"})
2. {remaining metric}
3. {remaining metric}
4. {remaining metric}
5. {remaining metric}

Or:
6. Create custom metric - Build your own evaluation metric (e.g., match on specific output fields, weighted scoring, domain-specific logic)
```

The built-in metrics and their descriptions (use these when filling in the template above):
- exact_match - Score 1.0 if strings match exactly
- fuzzy_match - Score based on string similarity (configurable threshold)
- contains_match - Score 1.0 if expected is contained in predicted
- redaction_match - Match text with redacted placeholders like [NAME]
- llm_judge - Use LLM to judge correctness (requires task description)

**⚠️ DO NOT suggest metrics not in this list** (e.g., do NOT suggest "bertscore", "bleu", "rouge", etc.). Only the 5 built-in metrics above and "Create custom metric" are valid options. If the user needs a metric not listed, guide them to option 6 (custom metric).

**Snowsight `ask_user_question` options** — include ALL 6 options below in every `ask_user_question` call. Do NOT filter or omit options based on the task type. Use these exact labels (do NOT paraphrase or invent new metric names):
- `"exact_match: Strict equality of outputs"`
- `"fuzzy_match: Token-level overlap — moderate flexibility"`
- `"contains_match: Expected answer appears in output"`
- `"redaction_match: Match with redacted placeholders like [NAME]"`
- `"llm_judge: LLM judges correctness (best for open-ended tasks)"`
- `"Create custom metric: Build your own evaluation logic"`

You may reorder to place the recommended metric first, but all 6 must be present.

**If user selects option 6:** Load `references/custom_metrics.md` to guide through custom metric creation. Preserve workflow context (function name, tables, columns) and return to the calling workflow after creation.
