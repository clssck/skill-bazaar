# Async Task Status

This reference explains how to check the status of async evaluation and optimization jobs.

## When to Load

Load when user wants to check status of an async job or asks about a run_id.

## Checking Task Status

**⚠️ ONE query per user message. Present result. End turn with `ask_user_question`. Never loop.** Do NOT call `TASK_HISTORY` more than once per turn. Do NOT poll automatically or re-query if the state is non-terminal — the user will come back and ask again.

Async jobs run as Snowflake Tasks. Use `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY()` to check status.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** Always ask the user for the database and schema before running any queries. Use `{database}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY()` with the user-provided database to ensure the query targets the correct location.

```sql
-- Check status of a specific run (replace {database} with user-provided value)
SELECT 
    NAME AS RUN_ID,
    STATE,
    SCHEDULED_TIME,
    COMPLETED_TIME,
    ERROR_MESSAGE
FROM TABLE({database}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY(
    TASK_NAME => '{run_id}',
    RESULT_LIMIT => 1
));
```

### Task States

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `SCHEDULED` | Task is queued to run |
| `EXECUTING` | Task is currently running |
| `SUCCEEDED` | Task completed successfully |
| `FAILED` | Task failed (check ERROR_MESSAGE) |
| `CANCELLED` | Task was cancelled |

## Checking Results

### Evaluation Results

Once state is `SUCCEEDED`, query the per-evaluation experiment. By default the experiment name equals the `run_id`, and the single run inside is named `EVAL`.

```sql
-- Aggregate score, num examples, function name, model from experiment metadata
SHOW RUN METRICS    IN EXPERIMENT {database}.{schema}.{experiment_name} RUN EVAL;
SHOW RUN PARAMETERS IN EXPERIMENT {database}.{schema}.{experiment_name} RUN EVAL;

-- Per-row results (requires ENABLE_EXPERIMENT_SNOWURL_READ_PATH_RESOLUTION).
-- Step 0 — create the JSON file format once per session. Inline
-- (FILE_FORMAT => (TYPE => JSON)) is NOT supported on SnowURL paths.
CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FILE FORMAT eval_detail_json_fmt
  TYPE = JSON
  STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY = TRUE;

SELECT
    $1:row_id::INT       AS ROW_ID,
    $1:input_text::STRING AS INPUT_TEXT,
    $1:expected::STRING  AS EXPECTED,
    $1:predicted::STRING AS PREDICTED,
    $1:metric_score::FLOAT AS SCORE,
    $1:metric_feedback::STRING AS FEEDBACK,
    $1:error_message::STRING AS ERROR_MESSAGE
FROM 'snow://experiment/{experiment_name}/versions/EVAL/eval_detail.json'
(FILE_FORMAT => eval_detail_json_fmt)
ORDER BY ROW_ID;

-- Analyze failures only
SELECT $1:row_id::INT AS ROW_ID, $1:expected::STRING AS EXPECTED,
       $1:predicted::STRING AS PREDICTED, $1:metric_score::FLOAT AS SCORE
FROM 'snow://experiment/{experiment_name}/versions/EVAL/eval_detail.json'
(FILE_FORMAT => eval_detail_json_fmt)
WHERE $1:metric_score::FLOAT < 1
ORDER BY SCORE;
```

### Optimization Results

Once state is `SUCCEEDED`, query the experiment for results:

```sql
-- List all runs and their status
SHOW RUNS IN EXPERIMENT {experiment_name};

-- Get seed and best scores for a specific model
-- Run names use the pattern: {MODEL}_SEED, {MODEL}_ITER_1, ..., {MODEL}_ITER_N, {MODEL}_FAILED
-- The winning run is the ITER or SEED run with the highest valset_score metric.
-- {MODEL}_FAILED indicates a model optimization that failed to produce a valid candidate.
-- where {MODEL} is the uppercased model name with non-alphanumeric chars replaced by _
-- Examples: llama3.1-8b -> LLAMA3_1_8B, claude-haiku-4-5 -> CLAUDE_HAIKU_4_5
SHOW RUN METRICS IN EXPERIMENT {experiment_name} RUN {MODEL}_SEED;

-- Find all runs and their scores to identify the winner:
SHOW RUNS IN EXPERIMENT {experiment_name};
-- Then query each ITER/SEED run's metrics to find the highest valset_score:
SHOW RUN METRICS IN EXPERIMENT {experiment_name} RUN {MODEL}_ITER_1;
-- The run with the highest valset_score is the winner (may be SEED if no iteration improved).
-- Get its optimized prompt/body:
SHOW RUN PARAMETERS IN EXPERIMENT {experiment_name} RUN {MODEL}_ITER_N;  -- replace N with winning iteration
```

For detailed candidate history (diagnostic, optional):

```sql
-- List all iteration runs for a model
SHOW RUNS IN EXPERIMENT {experiment_name};
-- Then query individual iteration run metrics:
SHOW RUN METRICS IN EXPERIMENT {experiment_name} RUN {MODEL}_ITER_1;
```

## Listing Recent Runs

To see all recent async jobs:

```sql
-- List recent evaluation/optimization tasks (use {database} prefix)
SELECT 
    NAME AS RUN_ID,
    STATE,
    SCHEDULED_TIME,
    COMPLETED_TIME,
    TIMESTAMPDIFF('SECOND', SCHEDULED_TIME, COALESCE(COMPLETED_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP())) AS DURATION_SECONDS,
    ERROR_MESSAGE
FROM TABLE({database}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY(
    RESULT_LIMIT => 20
))
WHERE NAME LIKE 'ai_func_eval_%' OR NAME LIKE 'ai_func_opt_%'
ORDER BY SCHEDULED_TIME DESC;
```

## Longer History

`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY()` only retains ~7 days of history. For older runs, use Account Usage (requires ACCOUNTADMIN or appropriate privileges):

```sql
-- Query task history up to 365 days
SELECT 
    NAME AS RUN_ID,
    STATE,
    SCHEDULED_TIME,
    COMPLETED_TIME,
    ERROR_MESSAGE
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.TASK_HISTORY
WHERE NAME = '{run_id}'
ORDER BY SCHEDULED_TIME DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

## Troubleshooting

### Task Not Found

If `TASK_HISTORY()` returns no results:
1. Verify the run_id is correct
2. Check if the task was created in a different database/schema
3. The task may have been cleaned up (tasks are suspended after execution)

### Task Failed

If state is `FAILED`:
1. Check `ERROR_MESSAGE` for details
2. Common issues:
   - **Warehouse privilege error** ("USAGE privilege on the task's warehouse must be granted to owner role"): The async SPROC now detects this before creating the task and returns an actionable error. If you see this in task history from an older SPROC version, it means the current role does not have a direct USAGE grant on the warehouse. Snowflake Tasks run under the owner role and require an explicit grant — session-level warehouse access via role hierarchy is not sufficient. Fix: either grant access (`GRANT USAGE ON WAREHOUSE {wh} TO ROLE {role}`) or re-run with a warehouse the role has access to via the `WAREHOUSE_NAME` parameter. To find usable warehouses: `SHOW GRANTS TO ROLE {role}` and look for USAGE on WAREHOUSE.
   - **Task timed out**: The async task exceeded its timeout limit (`USER_TASK_TIMEOUT_MS`). The default is 4 hours (240 minutes). Re-run with a larger `TIMEOUT_MINUTES` value, or reduce dataset size / optimization budget
   - Warehouse not available
   - Table/function not found
   - Out of memory (try smaller sample_size)

### Re-running a Failed Job

To re-run a failed job, simply call the async SPROC again. It will create a new task with a new run_id.

## Cancelling a Running Job

To cancel an async job that is currently `EXECUTING`:

```sql
-- Suspend the task to stop execution
ALTER TASK {database}.{schema}.{run_id} SUSPEND;

-- Then drop the task to clean up
DROP TASK IF EXISTS {database}.{schema}.{run_id};
```

Any partial results already written to the experiment or results table will remain available.

## Cleanup

Async tasks are automatically dropped after successful completion. No manual cleanup is needed for successful runs.

For failed runs where automatic cleanup did not execute, you can clean up manually:

```sql
-- Drop a specific task
DROP TASK IF EXISTS {database}.{schema}.{run_id};

-- List any remaining eval/opt tasks
SHOW TASKS LIKE 'ai_func_eval_%' IN SCHEMA {database}.{schema};
SHOW TASKS LIKE 'ai_func_opt_%' IN SCHEMA {database}.{schema};
```

## Resume Workflow

When a user returns in a new session to check on an async job, follow this workflow after determining the task state.

### If run_id not provided

Ask the user for it, or list recent runs using the "Listing Recent Runs" SQL above and let them pick.

### ⚠️ MANDATORY: Ask for database and schema

**Before running any status or results queries**, ask the user which database and schema the job was created in. Do NOT attempt broad account-level searches like `SHOW TASKS ... IN ACCOUNT` — these are slow and may fail due to permissions.

Ask:
```
Which database and schema was this job created in?
For example: MY_DATABASE.MY_SCHEMA
```

Use the provided database and schema for all subsequent `TASK_HISTORY()`, results table, and experiment queries. For example:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM TABLE({database}.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.TASK_HISTORY(
    TASK_NAME => '{run_id}',
    RESULT_LIMIT => 1
));
```

### Inferring experiment names from run_id

The run_id encodes the function name and timestamp:
- `ai_func_eval_FUNC_NAME_1709234567890` → function is `FUNC_NAME`, experiment name = the run_id itself (`ai_func_eval_FUNC_NAME_1709234567890`), single run inside is named `EVAL`
- `ai_func_opt_FUNC_NAME_1709234567890` → function is `FUNC_NAME`, experiment name is `FUNC_NAME_OPT_EXP`

To recover the function name: strip the `ai_func_eval_` or `ai_func_opt_` prefix and the trailing `_<13-digit-timestamp>` suffix. Use the database and schema provided by the user (from the mandatory step above) to fully qualify all references.

### If state is SCHEDULED or EXECUTING

Inform the user the job is still running. Show elapsed time from `SCHEDULED_TIME`. **Your turn MUST end here** — do NOT re-query, loop, or proceed to any next step.

```
Your job is still running ({elapsed} so far).

You can come back anytime and ask me to "check status of {run_id}".
```

Use `ask_user_question` with a single option: **"I'll come back later"**. Do NOT offer a "Check again" button. Do NOT re-query `TASK_HISTORY`. End your turn immediately after presenting this message.

### If state is FAILED or CANCELLED

Show the `ERROR_MESSAGE` from task history (if available). Offer to re-run:

```
Your job failed with error: {error_message}

Would you like to re-run it? Simply start a new evaluation or optimization workflow.
```

### If state is SUCCEEDED — Evaluation (run_id starts with `ai_func_eval_`)

1. The experiment name equals the run_id. Pull the aggregate score and metadata from experiment metadata:
   ```sql
   SHOW RUN METRICS    IN EXPERIMENT {database}.{schema}.{run_id} RUN EVAL;
   SHOW RUN PARAMETERS IN EXPERIMENT {database}.{schema}.{run_id} RUN EVAL;
   ```

   For the per-row error count and average score, query the `eval_detail.json` artifact directly (requires `ENABLE_EXPERIMENT_SNOWURL_READ_PATH_RESOLUTION`):
   ```sql
   CREATE OR REPLACE TEMPORARY FILE FORMAT eval_detail_json_fmt
     TYPE = JSON
     STRIP_OUTER_ARRAY = TRUE;

   SELECT AVG($1:metric_score::FLOAT) AS AVG_SCORE,
          COUNT(*) AS ROWS_EVALUATED,
          SUM(CASE WHEN $1:error_message::STRING <> '' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ERRORS
   FROM 'snow://experiment/{run_id}/versions/EVAL/eval_detail.json'
   (FILE_FORMAT => eval_detail_json_fmt);
   ```

2. Present results using the same format as `evaluate/SKILL.md` Step 5:
   ```
   Evaluation Results
   ==================

   Function: {function_name}
   Metric: {metric_name}  (from SHOW RUN PARAMETERS)
   Test Size: {n} examples
   Eval ID: {run_id}
   Experiment: {run_id}

   Average Score: {score:.1%}
   ```

3. Show the helpful queries (failures, score distribution, etc.) from `evaluate/SKILL.md` Step 5.

4. Present the `evaluate/SKILL.md` Step 6 next-steps menu:
   ```
   What would you like to do?
   1. Optimize (recommended) - Improve the function through function body optimization and model selection
   2. Done - Exit for now
   ```

   If optimize → Load `optimize/SKILL.md` with context from the results (function name, test table).

### If state is SUCCEEDED — Optimization (run_id starts with `ai_func_opt_`)

**⚠️ Environment-aware routing:** The optimize workflow has separate result flows for Snowsight and CLI. You MUST load the correct file before presenting results.

**If `environment == snowsight`:** Load `references/snowsight/optimize.md` and resume from its **Step 6** (Present Results). That file contains the complete Snowsight flow — result collection via `SHOW RUN METRICS`/`SHOW RUN PARAMETERS`, Pareto filtering in notebook cells, chart generation, user selection, and deployment. Follow it end-to-end through Step 8.

**If `environment == cli`:** Load `optimize/SKILL.md` and resume from its **Step 6** (Present Results). Follow the CLI result collection, Pareto frontier presentation, and deployment flow through Step 8.

In both cases, the experiment name is `{FUNCTION_NAME}_OPT_EXP` (inferred from the run_id — see "Inferring experiment names from run_id" above).
