# Adaptive Warehouse Tuning and Recommendations

## Tuning Parameters

Use the two parameters to tune performance headroom for your workload. These parameters control performance level and throughput capacity — they are not cost optimization levers. Adaptive delivers similar costs to Gen2 regardless of tuning.

| Workload | `MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL` | `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER` | Additional Controls |
|------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| Latency-sensitive / critical queries | XLARGE or higher | Higher (e.g., 4–8) | Resource monitors |
| Mixed / general-purpose workloads | MEDIUM–LARGE | Medium (e.g., 2–4) | Budgets |
| Low-complexity / batch workloads | Lower (SMALL–MEDIUM) | Lower (e.g., 2–4) | Strict budgets |

**Modify parameters on an existing warehouse:**
```sql
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{warehouse_name}}
  SET MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL = {{level}}
      QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER = {{multiplier}};
```

**View current settings:**
```sql
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '{{warehouse_name}}';
```

**When to adjust `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER` post-conversion:**
- **Queries are queueing** → increase QTM (more concurrent throughput capacity needed)
- **Workload is lighter than expected** → decrease QTM (reduce headroom to match actual concurrency)

## Data-Driven Tuning Recommendations

When a user asks how to tune a specific adaptive warehouse, ask which symptom they're experiencing, then run the corresponding diagnostic query and generate the ALTER SQL.

### Symptom 1 — Too Much Queueing

**Trigger keywords:** "queries are queuing", "jobs waiting", "high queue time", "slow due to queueing", "QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER too low"

**Step 1 — Diagnose with `WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY`:**

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('hour', start_time)          AS hour,
    AVG(avg_running)                        AS avg_running_jobs,
    AVG(avg_queued_load)                    AS avg_queued_load,
    AVG(avg_queued_provisioning)            AS avg_queued_provisioning,
    MAX(avg_queued_load)                    AS peak_queued_load
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.WAREHOUSE_LOAD_HISTORY
WHERE warehouse_name = '{{warehouse_name}}'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY avg_queued_load DESC
LIMIT 48;
```

If `avg_queued_load` is consistently > 0 or `peak_queued_load` is high, queueing is a real problem.

**Step 2 — Get current QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER:**

```sql
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '{{warehouse_name}}';
```

Look for the `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER` column.

**Step 3 — Recommend the adjustment:**

| Approach | Formula | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| Conservative | `CEIL(current * 1.2)` | ~20% increase; monitor for a week before tuning further |
| Aggressive | `current * 2` | Doubles throughput capacity; use when queueing is severe |

- Minimum value is `2`. If current is `0` (unlimited), no change needed — queueing is caused by something else.
- `0` (unlimited) is the ceiling — never recommend going above it.

**Step 4 — Present the ALTER SQL for approval:**

```sql
-- Conservative (~20% increase)
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{warehouse_name}}
  SET QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER = {{ceil(current * 1.2)}};

-- Aggressive (double)
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{warehouse_name}}
  SET QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER = {{current * 2}};
```

⚠️ **STOPPING POINT** — present both options and get explicit user approval before executing.

### Symptom 2 — Single Queries Running Slowly or Timing Out

**Trigger keywords:** "query is slow", "query timed out", "single job taking too long", "long-running query", "MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL too low"

**Step 1 — Diagnose with `QUERY_HISTORY`:**

```sql
SELECT
    query_id,
    query_text,
    start_time,
    ROUND(execution_time / 1000.0, 1)       AS execution_sec,
    ROUND(queued_overload_time / 1000.0, 1) AS queued_overload_sec,
    error_code,
    error_message
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_HISTORY
WHERE warehouse_name = '{{warehouse_name}}'
  AND start_time >= DATEADD(day, -7, CURRENT_DATE())
  AND (
      execution_time > 300000          -- longer than 5 minutes
      OR error_code IS NOT NULL        -- any error (catches timeouts)
  )
ORDER BY execution_time DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

If long execution times or timeout errors appear, `MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL` may be the lever.

**Step 2 — Get current MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL:**

```sql
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '{{warehouse_name}}';
```

**Step 3 — Recommend the adjustment:**

Performance level ordering (lowest → highest): `XSMALL`, `SMALL`, `MEDIUM`, `LARGE`, `XLARGE`, `XXLARGE`, `XXXLARGE`, `X4LARGE`

| Approach | Change | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Conservative | +1 level | Incremental bump; re-evaluate after a few days |
| Aggressive | +2 levels | Faster relief; use when queries are timing out |

- **Hard cap: `X4LARGE`** — never recommend above this.
- If already at `X4LARGE`, tell the user this is the maximum and suggest reviewing query optimization instead.

**Step 4 — Present the ALTER SQL for approval:**

```sql
-- Conservative (+1 level, e.g. XLARGE → XXLARGE)
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{warehouse_name}}
  SET MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL = {{current + 1}};

-- Aggressive (+2 levels, e.g. XLARGE → XXXLARGE)
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{warehouse_name}}
  SET MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL = {{current + 2}};
```

⚠️ **STOPPING POINT** — present both options and get explicit user approval before executing.

### Symptom 3 — Costs Are Too High

**Trigger keywords:** "too expensive", "costs are high", "reduce spend", "lower credits", "warehouse is costing too much"

> **Framing reminder:** Adaptive is a performance feature, not a cost-reduction feature. Before diving into tuning, acknowledge this: reducing parameters will trade performance for lower cost — the user should be aware of that tradeoff.

**Step 1 — Diagnose with `QUERY_METERING_HISTORY`:**

```sql
SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('day', query_start_time)     AS day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT query_id)                AS queries,
    SUM(credits_used)                       AS total_credits,
    ROUND(AVG(credits_used), 4)             AS avg_credits_per_query
FROM SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE.QUERY_METERING_HISTORY
WHERE warehouse_name = '{{warehouse_name}}'
  AND query_start_time >= DATEADD(day, -14, CURRENT_DATE())
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC;
```

Use this to understand whether spend is driven by **volume** (many queries) or **per-query cost** (expensive individual queries).

**Step 2 — Get current settings:**

```sql
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '{{warehouse_name}}';
```

**Step 3 — Recommend the adjustment:**

| Goal | Parameter | Change | Tradeoff |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| Reduce concurrent throughput capacity | `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER` | Reduce by ~20% (`FLOOR(current * 0.8)`, min 2) | More queueing at peak; jobs still run at full performance level |
| Reduce per-query compute | `MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL` | −1 level | Queries may run slower or time out |

- If spend is **volume-driven** → reducing `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER` is safer (limits parallel capacity).
- If spend is **per-query-driven** → reducing `MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL` targets the root cause but risks performance degradation.
- Minimum `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER` is `2`. If already at `2`, reducing further is not possible without setting to `0` (unlimited) — which would increase cost, not decrease it.
- Minimum `MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL` is `XSMALL` — never recommend below this.

**Step 4 — Present the ALTER SQL for approval:**

```sql
-- Option A: reduce throughput capacity by ~20%
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{warehouse_name}}
  SET QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER = {{max(floor(current_qtm * 0.8), 2)}};

-- Option B: reduce per-query performance level by 1
ALTER WAREHOUSE {{warehouse_name}}
  SET MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL = {{current_mqpl - 1}};
```

⚠️ **STOPPING POINT** — explain the tradeoffs, present both options, and get explicit user approval before executing.

## Should I Use Adaptive?

**Adaptive works well for:**
- Mixed workloads where query sizes vary widely — Adaptive Compute right-sizes each query automatically
- Dashboard and high-concurrency workloads — `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER` controls parallel capacity
- Teams that struggle to pick the right warehouse size — adaptive removes that decision
- Any workload currently using QAS — QAS usage is included in compute credits (no separate QAS credit line)

**Adaptive may not be ideal for:**
- Workloads requiring Snowpark-optimized memory configurations
- Very large queries that need X5LARGE or X6LARGE
- HTAP (key-value store access) workloads — Adaptive is not optimized for this query pattern; keep these warehouses on Standard
- Hybrid table queries — adaptive is not optimal for this workload type
- SLA-sensitive workloads that require precise, predictable performance guarantees — a well-tuned standard warehouse with a fixed size may offer more explicit control and predictability in those cases

**Price and performance framing:**
- Adaptive warehouses deliver **generally better performance at similar costs to Gen2**
- Do **not** quote a specific performance percentage — use "generally better performance at similar costs" language
- Cost is controlled via `MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL` and `QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER`, plus resource monitors and budgets
- The key simplification benefit is removing the need to right-size warehouses manually
- **Adaptive is not a cost-reduction feature.** If a user asks which warehouses to migrate in order to lower costs, correct the framing: adaptive delivers better performance at similar costs, not lower costs. The decision to migrate should be based on workload fit and operational simplicity, not cost savings.

## Which Warehouses to Migrate?

When a user asks which warehouses are good candidates for adaptive migration, frame the decision around **workload fit and performance**, not cost reduction.

**Good candidates (better performance fit):**
- Mixed workloads where query sizes vary widely — adaptive right-sizes each query automatically
- High-concurrency workloads currently using multi-cluster or QAS — adaptive handles concurrency via the shared pool
- Warehouses where teams struggle to pick the right size — adaptive removes that operational burden
- Workloads where operational simplicity matters more than explicit control

**Poor candidates (not a good fit):**
- Snowpark-optimized warehouses (not supported)
- Interactive warehouses (not supported)
- X5LARGE or X6LARGE warehouses (not supported)
- Hybrid table query workloads (adaptive is not optimal)
- SLA-sensitive workloads where precise, predictable performance is critical — a well-tuned standard warehouse may be a better fit
