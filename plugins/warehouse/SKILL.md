# Warehouse Skill Router

Route warehouse-related questions to the appropriate sub-skill.

> This router currently handles two sub-skills: gen2-warehouse and adaptive-warehouse. Additional sub-skills (sizing, monitoring, optimization, etc.) will be added here as they are developed.

## When to Use

Activate this skill when the user asks about any of:

- **Gen2 keywords**: "gen2", "generation 2", "GENERATION = '2'", "gen2 credit rate", "convert to gen2", "gen1 to gen2", "gen2 regions", "gen2 limitations", "gen2 performance", "warehouse generation", "gen2 benchmark", "compare gen1 gen2"
- **Performance keywords**: "DML performance", "slow DELETE", "slow MERGE", "slow resume", "resume time", "warehouse resume", "warehouse is slow", "speed up warehouse"
- **Warehouse creation/management**: "create warehouse", "alter warehouse", "warehouse size", "warehouse generation"
- **Warehouse cost/credits**: "warehouse credits", "warehouse cost", "how much is a warehouse", "warehouse pricing", "credits per hour"
- **Adaptive keywords**: "adaptive", "adaptive compute", "compute", "adaptive warehouse", "CREATE ADAPTIVE WAREHOUSE", "WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'ADAPTIVE'", "MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL", "QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER", "convert to adaptive", "adaptive warehouse billing"

## When NOT to Use

**Do NOT use this skill for Interactive Warehouse Questions.**
Questions like "what is an interactive warehouse" or "how do I use an interactive warehouse" should use the `interactive-warehouse` skill.

**Do NOT use this skill for warehouse spending or cost analytics.**
Questions like "how much did my warehouse spend?" or "show me warehouse credits used" belong to the `cost-intelligence` skill, which queries `SNOWFLAKE.ACCOUNT_USAGE`.
This skill covers warehouse configuration, DDL, Gen2, adaptive warehouses, and performance only.

## Routing

Match the user's question to keywords and load the corresponding sub-skill.

| Keywords | Sub-skill to Load |
|----------|-------------------|
| interactive warehouse, create interactive warehouse, add tables to warehouse, remove tables from warehouse, resume interactive warehouse, suspend interactive warehouse | **Route to** `snowflake-interactive` skill |
| adaptive, adaptive compute, compute, adaptive warehouse, CREATE ADAPTIVE WAREHOUSE, WAREHOUSE_TYPE = 'ADAPTIVE', convert to adaptive, MAX_QUERY_PERFORMANCE_LEVEL, QUERY_THROUGHPUT_MULTIPLIER, adaptive billing, adaptive tuning | **Load** `adaptive-warehouse/SKILL.md` |
| gen2, generation 2, GENERATION = '2', create gen2, convert to gen2, gen1 to gen2, gen2 credit rate, gen2 regions, gen2 limitations, gen2 performance, gen2 benchmark, compare gen1 gen2 | **Load** `gen2-warehouse/SKILL.md` |
| DML performance, slow DELETE, slow MERGE, slow UPDATE, slow resume, resume time, warehouse resume, warehouse is slow, speed up warehouse, improve warehouse performance | **Load** `gen2-warehouse/SKILL.md` |
| warehouse creation, warehouse size, warehouse generation, alter warehouse | **Load** `gen2-warehouse/SKILL.md` |
| warehouse credits, warehouse cost, how much is a warehouse, warehouse pricing, credits per hour | **Load** `gen2-warehouse/SKILL.md` |

> **Note:** Interactive warehouse questions route to the `snowflake-interactive` skill. Adaptive warehouse questions route to `adaptive-warehouse/SKILL.md`. All other warehouse intents route to `gen2-warehouse/SKILL.md`. As new sub-skills are added, this routing table will expand.

## Workflow

### Step 1: Look Up the Warehouse (if a specific warehouse is named)

If the user mentions a **specific warehouse by name**, you **MUST** run a lookup before routing:

```sql
SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '<warehouse_name>';
```

**IMPORTANT:** Always use `SHOW WAREHOUSES LIKE '<name>'` with the LIKE clause — do NOT use bare `SHOW WAREHOUSES` as it may fail with `ENABLE_ERROR_ON_FETCH_FALLBACK` errors on some accounts.

From the result, extract and note these columns:

| Column | Why It Matters |
|--------|---------------|
| `type` (warehouse_type) | Determines routing: INTERACTIVE → interactive skill, ADAPTIVE → adaptive sub-skill, SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED → Gen1-only (not supported in Gen2 or Adaptive), STANDARD → eligible for Gen2 |
| `generation` | If already `2`, tell the user it's already Gen2. If `1` or empty, may be a Gen2 candidate |
| `size` | Gen2 supports XSMALL through X4LARGE only. X5LARGE and X6LARGE are NOT supported |
| `resource_constraint` | Shows the resource constraint variant (e.g., `STANDARD_GEN_1`, `STANDARD_GEN_2`, `MEMORY_16X`). Confirms generation and warehouse configuration |

**Routing based on lookup results:**

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| `type` = `INTERACTIVE` | **Stop.** Tell the user this is an Interactive warehouse — Gen2 does not apply. Route to the `snowflake-interactive` skill for interactive warehouse questions |
| `type` = `ADAPTIVE` | Load `adaptive-warehouse/SKILL.md` |
| `type` = `SNOWPARK-OPTIMIZED` | **Stop.** Tell the user Snowpark-Optimized is a Gen1-only warehouse type — Gen2 and Adaptive are not supported. See Gen2 limitations in `gen2-warehouse/SKILL.md` |
| `generation` = `2` | Tell the user the warehouse is already Gen2. No conversion needed |
| `size` = `X5LARGE` or `X6LARGE` | Tell the user Gen2 does not support this size. Suggest benchmarking on a Gen2 X4LARGE |
| `type` = `STANDARD` and `generation` = `1` (or empty) | Eligible for Gen2. Proceed with keyword-based routing below |

**IMPORTANT:** Do NOT skip this lookup. Even if the user's question contains Gen2 keywords, the warehouse type takes priority — an INTERACTIVE warehouse should never receive Gen2 advice.

### Step 2: Detect Intent and Route

If no specific warehouse was named, or after the lookup confirms the warehouse is a STANDARD warehouse (Gen1 or Gen2), match the user's question to keywords and load the matching sub-skill.

### Step 3: Execute Sub-skill

Follow the loaded sub-skill's workflow completely. Each sub-skill is self-contained with its own references, workflows, and stopping points.

## Sub-skills

| Sub-skill | Skill | Purpose |
|-----------|-------|---------|
| Interactive Warehouse | `snowflake-interactive` (full skill name — not a sub-skill of this router) | Interactive warehouse creation, table management, resume/suspend |
| Adaptive Warehouse | `adaptive-warehouse/SKILL.md` | Adaptive warehouse creation, conversion, parameters, limitations, billing, tuning, analysis |
| Gen2 Warehouse | `gen2-warehouse/SKILL.md` | Gen2 explanation, creation, conversion, limitations, regions, costs, benchmarking, performance recommendations |

## Stopping Points

- If intent is ambiguous and cannot be mapped to a sub-skill, ask the user to clarify before loading any sub-skill
- Honour all stopping points defined within loaded sub-skills
