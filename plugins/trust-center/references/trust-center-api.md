# Trust Center API Reference

This reference documents the known Trust Center views and stored procedures in the `snowflake.trust_center` schema. Some views and procedures may not be present in every account. To discover what is actually available in the current account, you must use these commands:

```sql
-- List all available views
SHOW VIEWS IN SCHEMA snowflake.trust_center;

-- Inspect columns for a specific view
DESCRIBE VIEW snowflake.trust_center.<view_name>;

-- List all available stored procedures
SHOW PROCEDURES IN SCHEMA snowflake.trust_center;
```

## Required Roles

- `trust_center_admin` — Full access to all views and all stored procedures listed below.
- `trust_center_viewer` — Read-only access to all views. Cannot call configuration or mutation procedures (except `set_account_notification_enabled` and `get_trusted_extensions`).

For executing remediation SQL outside of Trust Center (e.g., setting network policies, disabling users), `ACCOUNTADMIN`, `SECURITYADMIN`, or roles with the necessary privileges are required.

## Key Concepts

### Finding Types (`SCANNER_TYPE`)

- **`Vulnerability`** — A persistent configuration issue (e.g., missing network policy). Remediation is a specific configuration change. Also called "Violation" — treat both terms as equivalent.
- **`Detection`** — A threat event or anomaly (e.g., unusual login activity). Requires investigation. `Alert` and `Threat` are legacy names — treat them identically to `Detection`.
- **`NULL`** — Type not set. Inspect the scanner description for context.

### Finding States

Case may vary — always use `UPPER()` in SQL comparisons:
- `Open` — Active finding with at-risk entities requiring attention
- `Resolved` — Finding has been resolved (either `TOTAL_AT_RISK_COUNT` dropped to 0 naturally, or manually set)
- `Muted` — Finding was manually muted via `post_finding_activity` (may show as `Resolved` in some accounts)
- `NULL` — State not yet determined

### Scanner Execution Types

- **Scheduled scanners** — Have a `SCHEDULE` value (cron expression). Run periodically. `TYPE` = `SCHEDULED`.
- **Event-driven scanners** — `SCHEDULE` is NULL. Trigger on relevant events. `LAST_SCAN_TIMESTAMP` will also be NULL even when enabled — this is normal. `TYPE` = `EVENT_DRIVEN`.

### AT_RISK_ENTITIES Structure

Each element is a JSON object with:
- `entity_id` — Unique identifier for the entity
- `entity_name` — Human-readable name
- `entity_object_type` — Type (not exhaustive): `PARAMETER`, `USER`, `TASK`, `PROCEDURE`, `NETWORK_POLICY`, `ACCOUNT`
- `entity_detail` — Object with type-specific details (e.g., current parameter value, role assignments)

---

## Stored Procedures

**Always use `SCANNER_PACKAGE_ID` and `SCANNER_ID` column values from the views when calling procedures. Never use display names like "CIS Benchmarks" — use the actual ID value from the `ID` column.**

```

**Notes:**
- Security Essentials package cannot have its `ENABLED` or `SCHEDULE` configuration changed (only `NOTIFICATION` is allowed).
- A scanner cannot be enabled if its parent package is disabled — enable the package first.
- When `NOTIFY_ADMINS` is `TRUE`, the `USERS` array is ignored.
- When `NOTIFY_ADMINS` is `FALSE` and `USERS` is empty, the notification configuration is invalid.
- Notification JSON format: `{"NOTIFY_ADMINS":"TRUE","SEVERITY_THRESHOLD":"CRITICAL","USERS":[]}`

CALL snowflake.trust_center.set_configurations(
  TO_JSON(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
    'ENABLED', 'TRUE',
    'SCHEDULE', 'USING CRON 0 6 * * * UTC'
  )),
  NULL, NULL, 'CIS_BENCHMARKS', false
);

-- Set multiple configs for an extension package
CALL snowflake.trust_center.set_configurations(
  TO_JSON(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
    'ENABLED', 'TRUE',
    'NOTIFICATION', TO_JSON(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
      'NOTIFY_ADMINS', 'TRUE',
      'SEVERITY_THRESHOLD', 'HIGH',
      'USERS', ARRAY_CONSTRUCT()
    ))
  )),
  'LISTING', '<listing_id>', 'MY_EXTENSION_PACKAGE', false
);
```

Raw JSON string (use only if the customer explicitly requests it):
```sql
-- Enable a package and set schedule in one call
CALL snowflake.trust_center.set_configurations(
  '{"ENABLED":"TRUE","SCHEDULE":"USING CRON 0 6 * * * UTC"}',
  NULL, NULL, 'CIS_BENCHMARKS', false
);

-- Set multiple configs for an extension package
CALL snowflake.trust_center.set_configurations(

### `snowflake.trust_center.submit_async_job`

Submits an asynchronous job for background processing. Returns a job ID that can be tracked via the `async_jobs` view.

**RBAC:** `trust_center_admin`

**Signature:** `submit_async_job(job_type VARCHAR, job_args VARCHAR)`

**Parameters:**
- `job_type` (VARCHAR) — The type of async job. Currently only `SET_PACKAGE_CONFIGURATION` is supported.
- `job_args` (VARCHAR) — JSON string with job-specific arguments. For `SET_PACKAGE_CONFIGURATION`:
  - **Required fields:**
    - `scanner_package_id` (VARCHAR) — The package ID
    - `configurations_json` (VARCHAR/OBJECT) — Configuration key-value pairs to apply
  - **Optional fields:**
    - `scanner_package_source_type` (VARCHAR) — `APPLICATION PACKAGE` or `LISTING`
    - `scanner_package_source` (VARCHAR) — Name of the application package or listing ID
    - `configuration_override` (BOOLEAN) — Whether package config overrides scanner config

**Returns:** VARCHAR — The job ID (UUID v4). Use this ID to track job status in the `async_jobs` view.

**Examples:**

Prefer `OBJECT_CONSTRUCT` for readability:
```sql
-- Submit an async job to enable a package with a schedule
CALL snowflake.trust_center.submit_async_job(
  'SET_PACKAGE_CONFIGURATION',
  TO_JSON(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
    'scanner_package_id', 'CIS_BENCHMARKS',
    'configurations_json', OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(
      'ENABLED', 'TRUE',
      'SCHEDULE', 'USING CRON 0 6 * * * UTC'
    )
  ))
);

-- Track job status
SELECT * FROM snowflake.trust_center.async_jobs WHERE job_id = '<returned_job_id>';
```

Raw JSON string (use only if the customer explicitly requests it):
```sql
CALL snowflake.trust_center.submit_async_job(
  'SET_PACKAGE_CONFIGURATION',
  '{"scanner_package_id":"CIS_BENCHMARKS","configurations_json":{"ENABLED":"TRUE","SCHEDULE":"USING CRON 0 6 * * * UTC"}}'
);
```

**Notes:**
- Only one active job (status `PENDING` or `PROCESSING`) is allowed per scanner package per job type. Submitting a duplicate raises an error — wait for the existing job to complete first.
- The job is immediately triggered for processing after insertion, but execution is asynchronous.
- Job status progression: `PENDING` -> `PROCESSING` -> `COMPLETED` or `FAILED`.
- Use the `async_jobs` view to monitor status. The `scanner_packages` view also exposes `LATEST_ASYNC_JOB_ID`, `LATEST_ASYNC_JOB_STATUS`, and `LATEST_ASYNC_JOB_ERROR_MESSAGE` columns.

## Scanner Packages

### First-Party Packages (pre-installed)

| Package | Description | Default Schedule | Schedule Configurable? | Cost |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|----------------------|------|
| Security Essentials | Snowflake-recommended checks | Monthly | No (fixed, but on-demand runs can be triggered) | Default monthly run is free. Ad-hoc runs incur credits. |
| CIS Benchmarks | Snowflake CIS Benchmark scanners | Daily | Yes | Credits consumed per scan |
| Threat Intelligence | Detection scanners for unauthorized access risks | Daily/event-driven | Yes | Credits consumed per scan |
| AI Security | AI-related security configurations and usage monitoring | Daily | Yes | Credits consumed per scan |

### Extension-Based Packages

These come from the Snowflake Trust Center extension and include packages such as Roles, Secrets & Privileged Access, Sharing, Users, Authentication, Configuration, and Application Security. Their scanner IDs are not in the first-party mapping below — always query the views to look up their IDs:

```sql
SELECT s.ID AS scanner_id, s.NAME, s.SCANNER_PACKAGE_ID, sp.NAME AS package_name, sp.STATE AS package_state
FROM snowflake.trust_center.scanners s
LEFT JOIN snowflake.trust_center.scanner_packages sp ON s.SCANNER_PACKAGE_ID = sp.ID
WHERE s.NAME ILIKE '%<search term>%' OR s.SHORT_DESCRIPTION ILIKE '%<search term>%';
```
